# Meeting 3: Architecture, Autonomy, and Lean Thinking
**Week 5 | Duration:** 1 Hour

## Pre-Reading Assignment
**Chapters:** 9-12 (Organizational and Management Practices)
- Chapter 9: Making Work Sustainable
- Chapter 10: Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement
- Chapter 11: Leaders and Managers
- Chapter 12: Diversity in Tech

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Modular/Loosely Coupled Architecture
- **Independent Team Work:** Teams can work without relying on other teams for support and services
- **Reduced Coordination Overhead:** Less communication required for changes
- **Kitchen Analogy:** Like chefs working independently on their dishes without constant coordination
- **Conway's Law Inverse:** Evolving team structures to match desired architecture

### 2. Empowerment Through Tool Selection
- **Autonomy Impact:** How tool choice freedom enhances creativity and productivity
- **Balance with Standardization:** Providing easy-to-use security protocols and basic systems
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Connection between autonomy and job satisfaction
- **Innovation Driver:** How flexible tool policies lead to better solutions

### 3. Lean Management Principles
- **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):** Using WIP limits to manage flow and drive process improvement
- **Visualize Work:** Making work and metrics visible to the team
- **Lightweight Change Approval:** Peer review over external change approval boards
- **Customer Feedback Integration:** Getting early and frequent customer input

## Discussion Questions
1. **Architecture Assessment:** How well does your current architecture enable independent team work?
2. **Tool Autonomy:** What level of tool selection freedom do teams currently have?
3. **Lean Practices:** Which lean management practices are you currently using? Which could be adopted?
4. **WIP Visibility:** How do you currently visualize and limit work in progress?
5. **Developer Satisfaction:** What factors most impact job satisfaction in your organization?

## Practical Exercises
- Map current dependencies between teams and systems
- Identify bottlenecks in current change approval processes
- Assess current WIP limits and visualization practices

## Action Items for Next Meeting
- Document one architectural dependency that slows down your team
- Experiment with visualizing work using a simple kanban board
- Identify one process that could benefit from peer review instead of external approval
