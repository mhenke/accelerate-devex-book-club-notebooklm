# Meeting 2: Cultivating Culture and Embracing Continuous Delivery
**Week 3 | Duration:** 1 Hour

## Pre-Reading Assignment
**Chapters:** 5-8 (Continued Research Findings)
- Chapter 5: Architecture
- Chapter 6: Integrating Infosec into the Delivery Lifecycle
- Chapter 7: Management Practices for Software
- Chapter 8: Product Development

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Organizational Culture Types (Westrum's Typology)
- **Pathological (Power-Oriented):** Low cooperation, messengers shot, responsibility shirked
- **Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented):** Modest cooperation, messengers neglected, narrow responsibilities
- **Generative (Performance-Oriented):** High cooperation, messengers trained, risks shared, bridging encouraged

### 2. "Act Your Way into a Better Culture"
- **Behavioral Change Drives Cultural Change:** How implementing practices transforms organizational culture
- **Practical Application:** Concrete actions that shift culture toward generative
- **Evidence:** Research showing DevOps practices improve both performance and culture

### 3. Continuous Delivery as Disciplined Approach
- **Definition:** Getting changes of all kinds into production safely, quickly, and sustainably
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments
- **Foundation:** The "engine that drives all of this" high performance

### 4. Core CD Principles and Practices
- **Build Quality In:** Starting with quality rather than inspecting it later
- **Work in Small Batches:** Breaking tasks into manageable, testable units
- **Automate Repetitive Tasks:** Freeing humans for creative problem-solving
- **Version Control Everything:** All production artifacts under version control
- **Trunk-Based Development:** Short-lived branches and frequent integration
- **Comprehensive Test Automation:** Automated testing at multiple levels
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Observability and alerting for rapid problem detection

## Discussion Questions
1. **Culture Assessment:** Using Westrum's model, how would you categorize your current organizational culture?
2. **Cultural Transformation Examples:** What behavioral changes have you seen that shifted culture?
3. **CD Maturity:** Which continuous delivery practices is your organization currently implementing?
4. **Automation Opportunities:** What repetitive tasks could be automated to improve developer experience?

## Real-World Applications
- Share examples of successful cultural shifts through practice implementation
- Discuss barriers to continuous delivery adoption
- Identify quick wins for improving CD practices

## Action Items for Next Meeting
- Observe and document culture type indicators in your daily work
- Identify one repetitive task that could be automated
- Experiment with working in smaller batches on current projects
