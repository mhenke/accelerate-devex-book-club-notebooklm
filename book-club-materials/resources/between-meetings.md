# Between-Meeting Activities

## Observation Journals
Track examples of concepts discussed in daily work:
- Document instances of cultural behaviors (pathological, bureaucratic, generative)
- Note deployment pain points and friction
- Record examples of speed vs. stability trade-offs
- Observe team autonomy and tool selection freedom

## Small Experiments
Try implementing one small change between sessions:
- Begin tracking one DORA metric informally
- Implement a simple kanban board for work visualization
- Experiment with smaller batch sizes for current projects
- Try automating one repetitive task

## Metric Collection
Begin informal measurement of DORA metrics:
- **Delivery Lead Time:** Track time from commit to production
- **Deployment Frequency:** Count deployments per week/month
- **Time to Restore Service:** Measure incident response times
- **Change Fail Rate:** Calculate percentage of failed deployments

## Culture Indicators
Notice and document cultural behaviors and patterns:
- How are problems reported and received?
- What happens when things go wrong?
- How much collaboration exists across teams?
- Are messengers welcomed or blamed?

## Reflection Questions for Personal Use
- What did I learn about my organization this week?
- What small change could I try next week?
- How do the book's concepts apply to my daily work?
- What would I want to discuss with the group?
