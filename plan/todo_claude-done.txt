General Material Design Principles:

    mobile first:     Responsiveness: All components should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

    Elevation & Shadows: Use subtle shadows to indicate hierarchy and interactivity (e.g., clickable cards).

    Clear Typography: Use a consistent, readable font family (like Roboto, common in Material Design).

    Color Palette: Use a primary and secondary color, with accent colors for key actions.  The meeting pages have their own color themes like blue, teal, yellow, and purple. they whole page needs to follow this with their own primary, secondary, and approrpriate accecent colors.

    Consistent Icons: Use a unified set of icons.

    Whitespace: Use ample whitespace to reduce clutter and improve readability.

replace principle-card and dimension-card with insight-cards

rename security-stat to stats-card

meeting 2 Action Items for Next Meeting not styled correctly like other meeting Action Items for Next Meeting sections

for Related Resources add some simple bullet point for the list items to show they are links on all the meeting and transformation page like meeting 1 has.

meeting 4 transformation-mindset-requirements, Next Steps: Continue Your Transformation, ING Transformation Lessons, Practical Exercises,  is not styled like our site.  Action Items and Commitments is too verbose and not like the similiar Action Items for Next Meeting  sections. make Culminating Reflection pop and be visually appealing.  Related Resources is not like other Related Resources sections


law-statement use law-statement component
insight-card use insight card component
meeting 1 Action Items for Next Meeting action-cards should more a bullet list and resuable component. if it is not already

improvement priority and  Culture Assessment should use the Reusable Interactive Learning Checkpoint Card Component in the meeting 1 page

Research Finding, watch video and watch podcast should be three resuable components

I want to be able to drop checkpoint-card cards on different pages. please refactor for encapsulation and reusabilty. <div class="checkpoint-card deployment-anxiety">
    <h4 id="deployment-confidence"><em class="fas fa-heart"></em> Deployment Confidence</h4>
    <p>How does your team feel about deployments?</p>
    <div class="confidence-options">
<label class="confidence-item performance-low"> <input type="radio" name="deployment-confidence" value="anxious"> <span class="radio-mark"></span> Anxious &amp; Stressful </label> <label class="confidence-item performance-medium"> <input type="radio" name="deployment-confidence" value="neutral"> <span class="radio-mark"></span> Manageable but Tense </label> <label class="confidence-item performance-high"> <input type="radio" name="deployment-confidence" value="confident"> <span class="radio-mark"></span> Confident &amp; Routine </label>
    </div>
    <div class="feedback-area active feedback-high" id="confidence-feedback"><h5>Confident Deployment Culture</h5><p>Excellent! Confident, routine deployments indicate strong DevOps practices. Your team likely has good test automation, deployment automation, and monitoring. Continue refining these practices and help other teams achieve similar confidence through knowledge sharing.</p></div>
  </div>

continue and add a  resusable Related Resources card and  Tool Freedom. the tool freedom   │
│   resusable component should be call resuable slider checkpoint card        
reusable component application-card 


when click an interactive card on meeting 2

we should also test stylelint and make sure green after our changes

> stylelint "docs/assets/**/*.scss" "docs/_sass/**/*.scss" "docs/**/*.html"


docs/assets/critical.scss

we don't need the left borders on answers before selectin like 
.assessment-btn.performance-low {
  border-left: 4px solid #dc2626;
}

Transformation Readiness should use the existing resuable checkbox checkpoint card

pain-side security-approach confusion-solution arch-side and all similiar along with their parent div like wall-confusion-section and conway-examples. create resuable components. audit their usages. maybe a section then side component. 

transformation-complete need a audit. itis the final summary of our transformation journy and should line up with content covered in index like  What You’ll Learn and then meeting pages. meeting 4 is the final meeting. it is not a summary/complete page. that should be transformation-complete

update meeting 3 to use the existing resuable includes and follows the same patterns as meeting 1 and 2.

update meeting 4 to use the existing reusable includes and follow the same patterns as meeting 1, 2, and 3. meeting 4 discussion is not matching other discussion meeting sections using the reusable component
