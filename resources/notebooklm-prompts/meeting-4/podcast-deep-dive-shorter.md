## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
TARGET AUDIENCE:
Assume the listener needs a quick overview of the most critical leadership and transformation concepts before the final book club meeting. They're short on time but want the essentials.

SOURCE FOCUS:
Focus on Chapters 11, 16, and Conclusion from uploaded Accelerate sources.

FORMAT & LENGTH:
Create a concise 10-15 minute podcast. Focus on essentials only - five leadership characteristics (names + brief explanations), three ING practices, and roadmap approach. Skip detailed implementation guidance.

TOPICS TO COVER:

1. TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP - FIVE CHARACTERISTICS (4 minutes)

   Just name and briefly explain each:

   1. Vision: Clear direction and purpose
   2. Inspirational communication: Motivates and energizes
   3. Intellectual stimulation: Encourages experimentation and innovation
   4. Supportive leadership: Removes obstacles, provides resources
   5. Personal recognition: Acknowledges contributions and successes

   KEY POINT: Leadership enables practices, doesn't directly improve DORA metrics

   INDIRECT EFFECT: Leadership → Better practices → Better culture → Better outcomes

2. ING CASE STUDY - THREE KEY TAKEAWAYS (3 minutes)

   ING Netherlands transformed from traditional bank to high-performing agile organization

   THREE PRACTICES TO KNOW:

   a) Obeya Rooms:
      - Visual management rooms where work is visible
      - Leadership visits regularly to understand status
      - Enables informed decision-making

   b) Catchball:
      - Collaborative goal-setting (not top-down)
      - Goals "thrown" between leadership and teams
      - Creates ownership and realistic commitments

   c) Empowered Teams:
      - Cross-functional squads with autonomy
      - Teams own services end-to-end
      - Leadership provides support, not detailed control

   WHY IT WORKED: CEO commitment + years of patient implementation + both technical AND cultural change

3. YOUR TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP (3 minutes)

   REFLECT ON 7-WEEK JOURNEY:
   - Review DORA metrics: What improved?
   - Assess culture: What shifted?
   - Evaluate practices: What stuck?

   CREATE ROADMAP:
   - Next 3 months: 2-3 high-impact practices (quick wins)
   - Next 6 months: Medium-difficulty improvements
   - Next 12 months: Long-term transformations

   HOW TO SUSTAIN:
   - Regular retrospectives (monthly/quarterly)
   - Practice working groups
   - Leadership engagement and updates
   - Continuous learning (next book club, conferences)

   THIS IS THE BEGINNING, NOT THE END

DISCUSSION PREPARATION:
Help listeners discuss which leadership characteristic is most present/absent in their org, which ING practice (Obeya, catchball, empowered teams) they could adapt, what to prioritize in next 3 months, and how to sustain momentum.
