## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
Assume listener is skeptical. Focus Ch 7-10 Accelerate. Create 15-20min critical: (1) Lean reality (WIP limits disrupt flow? Visual overhead? Alert fatigue?), (2) Deployment causation (correlation vs causation? Other burnout factors?), (3) Satisfaction oversimplified (compensation? Growth? Work-life missing?). Discuss: when Lean doesn't work, other burnout causes, satisfaction complexity.
