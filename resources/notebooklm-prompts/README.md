**Purpose:** Reinforce learning, catchup for absent members

### Throughout Book Club
**Generate progressively:**

- Week 2: Meeting 2 Brief for participants
- Repeat for Meetings 3-4

---

## Customization Tips

### Adjust for Your Context

While prompts are copy-paste ready, you can customize by:

1. **Adding your team's context** to sources:
   - Upload your DORA metrics baseline
   - Include your pain points documentation
   - Add your culture assessment

2. **Modifying prompts** (optional):
   - Add your industry-specific examples
   - Emphasize topics most relevant to your team
   - Adjust length guidance

### Format Combinations

**Effective combinations:**
- **Brief** (for all) + **Longer Deep Dive** (for facilitator)
- **Default Deep Dive** (pre-meeting) + **Critique** (post-meeting)
- **Video** (team viewing) + **Brief** (individual prep)

---

## Troubleshooting

### NotebookLM says "Source material doesn't match prompt"
- Make sure you uploaded the correct chapters (see `ALL-SOURCES-TO-UPLOAD.md`)
- Try uploading chapter notes as additional source

### Generated content is too generic
- Upload more specific sources (your team's metrics, pain points)
- Use Longer Deep Dive format for more detail

### Audio is too long/short
- Use different length variant (Shorter/Default/Longer)
- Brief format is shortest (5-10 min)

### Want different perspective
- Try Critique format (skeptical analysis)
- Try Debate format (multiple viewpoints)

---

## Best Practices

### For Facilitators

‚úÖ **Generate 3 days before meeting** - Give participants time to listen
‚úÖ **Use Default Deep Dive for yourself** - Comprehensive prep
‚úÖ **Share Brief with participants** - Easier to consume
‚úÖ **Listen before sharing** - Ensure quality matches expectations
‚úÖ **Provide context when sharing** - "This is AI-generated supplement, not replacement for reading"

‚úÖ **Take notes while listening** - Capture questions for discussion
‚úÖ **Don't treat as replacement for reading** - Supplement, not substitute

### For Organizations

‚úÖ **Create library** - Generate all formats for all meetings upfront
