### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Assume listener wants comprehensive understanding. Focus Ch 4-6 Accelerate. Create 20-25min detailed: (1) CD - 5 principles WITH examples + 8 practices individually WITH DORA connection, (2) Loosely coupled arch - characteristics, assessment, culture connection, (3) Shift-left security - traditional vs new, implementation. Discuss practices have vs need, architecture enabling/preventing CD, security model, starting point.
```

LENGTH: 20-25 minutes. Include all practices with detailed explanations, examples, implementation guidance, and connections to metrics and culture.

DISCUSSION PREP:
