## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
TARGET AUDIENCE:
Assume the viewer is a technical team member, architect, or engineering leader who prefers visual learning. They're watching to understand continuous delivery practices, architecture patterns, and security integration before a book club discussion.

SOURCE FOCUS:
Focus on Chapters 4-6 from uploaded Accelerate sources.

FORMAT & LENGTH:
Create a 10-15 minute visual video summary with diagrams, flowcharts, and animations. Use pipeline diagrams for CD practices, architecture diagrams (boxes/arrows) for coupling concepts, timeline comparisons for shift-left security, and cycle diagrams for virtuous cycles.

VIDEO SEGMENTS:

1. THE 8 CD PRACTICES (Visual: 8 connected building blocks)
   - Version control, deployment automation, CI, trunk-based development, test automation, test data management, shift-left security, CD capability
   - Show each with icon, one-line description, and connection to DORA metrics
   - Key visual: "CD is the ENGINE driving high performance"

2. LOOSELY COUPLED ARCHITECTURE (Visual: Side-by-side comparison)
   - LEFT: Tightly coupled (tangled dependencies, teams blocked, "can't deploy without coordination")
   - RIGHT: Loosely coupled (clear APIs, independent deployment, "deploy independently")
   - Key text: "Architecture matters MORE than microservices vs. monolith"
   - Culture impact: Tight coupling → blame/delays, Loose coupling → trust/autonomy

3. SHIFT-LEFT SECURITY (Visual: Timeline comparison)
   - BEFORE: Security gate at end (bottleneck, late feedback, expensive fixes)
   - AFTER: Security integrated throughout (automated testing, pre-approved tools, fast feedback)
   - Key text: "Improves BOTH speed AND security - no trade-off"

4. PRACTICES → METRICS → CULTURE CYCLE (Visual: Virtuous cycle diagram)
   - Technical practices → DORA metrics improve → Culture transforms → Enables more practices

DISCUSSION PREPARATION:
Help viewers identify which of the 8 CD practices they're missing, whether their architecture enables independent deployment, if security is a gate or integrated practice, and what's the smallest change they could make this week.
