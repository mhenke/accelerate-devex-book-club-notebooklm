## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
BOOK CLUB CONTEXT:
Create a visual video summary for Meeting 2 of an Accelerate DevEx Book Club covering Chapters 4-6. Use diagrams, flowcharts, and visuals to make technical practices, architecture patterns, and security integration clear.

MEETING 2 CORE QUESTION:
"Which of our current practices create the most friction, and what is the smallest technical change we could make to enable more independent, 'shift-left' work?"

VIDEO STRUCTURE:

INTRO (30 seconds):
- Title: "Accelerate Book Club - Meeting 2: Technical Excellence"
- Chapters 4-6: Technical Practices, Architecture, Integrating Infosec
- Connection to Meeting 1: These practices drive the DORA metrics

SEGMENT 1: THE 8 CD PRACTICES (4 minutes)
Visual: Show as 8 connected building blocks or gears

1. Version Control - Show repository icon
2. Deployment Automation - Show pipeline visualization
3. Continuous Integration - Show merge/build cycle
4. Trunk-Based Development - Show branching diagram (short-lived branches)
5. Test Automation - Show test pyramid
6. Test Data Management - Show data provisioning
7. Shift-Left Security - Show security integrated in pipeline
8. Continuous Delivery - Show always-deployable trunk

Visual overlay: "CD is the ENGINE driving high performance"

For each practice, show:
- Icon/illustration
- One-line description
- How it improves DORA metrics

SEGMENT 2: LOOSELY COUPLED ARCHITECTURE (3 minutes)
Visual: Side-by-side comparison

LEFT - Tightly Coupled:
- Diagram showing tangled dependencies
- Teams blocked waiting for each other
- Monolithic deployment
- Label: "Can't deploy without coordination"

RIGHT - Loosely Coupled:
- Diagram showing independent services with clear APIs
- Teams deploying independently
- Parallel timelines
- Label: "Deploy independently"

KEY VISUAL: Arrow showing progression from left to right
On-screen text:
- "Architecture matters MORE than microservices vs. monolith"
- "Can you test and deploy without depending on other teams?"

Show impact on culture:
- Tightly coupled → Blame, delays, meetings
- Loosely coupled → Trust, speed, autonomy

SEGMENT 3: SHIFT-LEFT SECURITY (2-3 minutes)
Visual: Timeline comparison

BEFORE (Security Gate):
- Linear timeline: Dev → QA → Security Review → Deploy
- Bottleneck at security review
- Red X showing blocked deployments
- Late feedback, expensive fixes

AFTER (Shift-Left):
- Security integrated throughout
- Automated security testing in pipeline
- Pre-approved tools
- Green checkmarks throughout
- Fast feedback, cheaper fixes

On-screen text:
- "Improves BOTH speed AND security quality"
- "No trade-off"

Show transformation:
- Security from blocker → enabler
- Separate team → shared responsibility

SEGMENT 4: HOW PRACTICES DRIVE METRICS & CULTURE (2 minutes)
Visual: Virtuous cycle diagram

TECHNICAL PRACTICES →
- Automation
- Testing
- Architecture
- Security integration

→ DORA METRICS IMPROVE
- Faster deployments
- Lower fail rate
- Faster recovery

→ CULTURE TRANSFORMS
- Trust increases
- Collaboration improves
- Generative behaviors emerge

→ ENABLES MORE PRACTICES (cycle continues)

SEGMENT 5: CALL TO ACTION (1 minute)
On-screen questions:
1. Which of the 8 CD practices are you missing?
2. Can you deploy without coordinating with other teams?
3. Is security a gate or integrated practice?
4. What's the smallest change you could make this week?

Resources shown:
- Meeting 2 outline
- 24 Capabilities Assessment (practices 1-8)
- DORA metrics template

VISUAL STYLE:
- Use pipeline/flowchart diagrams for CD practices
- Architecture diagrams (boxes and arrows) for coupling concepts
- Timeline comparisons for shift-left security
- Cycle/loop diagrams for virtuous cycles
- Color code: Green for loosely coupled/shift-left, Red for tightly coupled/gates
- Icons for each practice

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Technical teams, architects, engineering leaders who prefer visual learning. Teams watching together before book club meeting.

LENGTH GUIDANCE:
10-15 minutes. Balance narration with diagrams. Ensure technical concepts are visualized, not just explained verbally.

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Captions for all narration
- High contrast diagrams
- Label all visual elements clearly
