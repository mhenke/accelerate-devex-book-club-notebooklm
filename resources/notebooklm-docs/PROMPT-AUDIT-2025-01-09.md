# NotebookLM Prompt Comprehensive Audit

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Auditor:** AI Assistant
**Scope:** All 24 prompt files across Meeting 1-4

## Executive Summary

Audit of all NotebookLM prompts against [PROMPT-BEST-PRACTICES.md](PROMPT-BEST-PRACTICES.md) reveals significant issues:

- **Only 3 of 24 prompts (12.5%)** meet the optimal 1000-1500 character target
- **16 prompts (67%)** are too long (>2000 characters), with some exceeding 13,000 characters
- **3 prompts (12.5%)** are too short (<1000 characters)
- All prompts follow structural best practices (TARGET AUDIENCE, SOURCE FOCUS, etc.)

## Detailed Findings

### Character Count Analysis

| Status | Count | Percentage | Target Range |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|
| ✅ Optimal | 3 | 12.5% | 1000-1500 chars |
| ⚠️ Short | 3 | 12.5% | <1000 chars |
| ⚠️ Long | 2 | 8.3% | 1500-2000 chars |
| ❌ Too Long | 16 | 67% | >2000 chars |

### Files by Status

#### ✅ Optimal (1000-1500 characters)

1. `meeting-1/podcast-brief.md` - 1359 chars
2. `meeting-3/podcast-brief.md` - 1260 chars
3. `meeting-4/podcast-brief.md` - 1428 chars

**Analysis:** Brief formats are well-optimized, showing the pattern works.

#### ⚠️ Short (<1000 characters)

1. `meeting-1/podcast-deep-dive-default.md` - 507 chars
2. `meeting-1/podcast-deep-dive-shorter.md` - 457 chars
3. `meeting-2/podcast-deep-dive-longer.md` - 533 chars

**Analysis:** These prompts are too terse and lack sufficient context.

**Fix Required:** Expand with:
- More specific topic guidance
- Key statistics/findings to emphasize
- Clearer discussion preparation questions

#### ⚠️ Long (1500-2000 characters)

1. `meeting-2/podcast-brief.md` - 1855 chars
2. `meeting-2/podcast-deep-dive-shorter.md` - 1768 chars

**Analysis:** Slightly over target but acceptable. Minor trimming recommended.

**Fix Required:** Remove 200-300 characters of redundant content.

#### ❌ Too Long (>2000 characters)

**Critical Issues (>5000 characters):**

1. `meeting-3/podcast-deep-dive-longer.md` - **11,689 chars** (7.8x target!)
2. `meeting-4/podcast-deep-dive-longer.md` - **13,012 chars** (8.7x target!)
3. `meeting-4/podcast-critique.md` - **8,088 chars** (5.4x target!)
4. `meeting-4/podcast-deep-dive-default.md` - **8,059 chars** (5.4x target!)
5. `meeting-3/podcast-critique.md` - **6,942 chars** (4.6x target!)
6. `meeting-3/podcast-debate.md` - **6,495 chars** (4.3x target!)
7. `meeting-4/podcast-debate.md` - **6,099 chars** (4.1x target!)

**Moderate Issues (2000-5000 characters):**

8. `meeting-2/podcast-critique.md` - 3,950 chars
9. `meeting-2/podcast-deep-dive-default.md` - 2,842 chars
10. `meeting-2/podcast-debate.md` - 2,731 chars
11. `meeting-3/podcast-deep-dive-default.md` - 2,721 chars
12. `meeting-4/podcast-deep-dive-shorter.md` - 2,766 chars
13. `meeting-1/podcast-critique.md` - 2,193 chars
14. `meeting-1/podcast-debate.md` - 2,054 chars
15. `meeting-1/podcast-deep-dive-longer.md` - 2,051 chars
16. `meeting-3/podcast-deep-dive-shorter.md` - 2,035 chars

**Analysis:** Later meetings (3 & 4) have more complex content, leading to extreme verbosity. Prompts attempted to include too much detail rather than trusting uploaded sources.

**Fix Required:** Aggressive condensation:
- Remove redundant explanations
- Convert detailed lists to high-level themes
- Remove examples (trust sources for those)
- Focus on WHAT to cover, not HOW to say it

## Best Practices Compliance

All prompts follow the structural pattern:

✅ **Target Audience** - All prompts specify audience clearly
✅ **Source Focus** - All prompts explicitly name sources
✅ **Format & Length** - All prompts specify podcast length
✅ **Topics Structured** - All prompts use numbered/bulleted topics
✅ **Discussion Prep** - All prompts include discussion questions
✅ **Section Separation** - All separate copy-paste prompt from extended context

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Prompts Became Too Long

1. **Content Complexity Creep:** Meetings 3-4 cover more topics, prompts tried to explain everything
2. **Distrust of Source Upload:** Prompts included details that should come from uploaded sources
3. **Over-Specification:** Attempted to control exact wording instead of guiding topics
4. **Inconsistent Standards:** Earlier prompts (Meeting 1-2) were reviewed, later ones weren't

### Pattern Comparison

**Good Example (Meeting 1 Brief - 1359 chars):**
```
- Clear, concise topic headers
- Single key statistic per topic
- High-level themes only
- Trusts sources for details
```

**Bad Example (Meeting 4 Deep Dive Longer - 13,012 chars):**
```
- Exhaustive topic coverage
- Multiple sub-bullets with details
- Attempts to include all content
- Doesn't trust sources
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Critical Issues (7 files >5000 chars):**
   - Reduce by 70-80% to reach 1000-1500 target
   - Remove all detailed explanations
   - Keep only topic headers and key points

2. **Fix Moderate Issues (9 files 2000-5000 chars):**
   - Reduce by 40-60% to reach target
   - Consolidate redundant sections
   - Remove examples

3. **Fix Short Prompts (3 files <1000 chars):**
   - Add 300-500 characters
   - Include key statistics to emphasize
   - Clarify discussion questions

### Process Improvements (Priority 2)

1. **Character Count Validation:**
   - Add automated check to pre-commit hooks
   - Fail CI/CD if any prompt exceeds 1500 chars

2. **Prompt Template:**
   - Create a strict template with character budget per section
   - Example: TARGET AUDIENCE (150), SOURCE (100), FORMAT (100), TOPICS (800), DISCUSSION (150)

3. **Review Process:**
   - All new prompts reviewed against PROMPT-BEST-PRACTICES.md
   - Character count checked before commit

### Long-Term Strategy (Priority 3)

1. **Trust the Sources:**
   - Prompts should guide WHAT to cover, not HOW
   - Detailed content comes from uploaded sources
   - Focus on topic selection and emphasis

2. **Consistent Voice:**
   - Brief prompts use "essential takeaways only" pattern
   - Deep dive uses "conversational but thorough" pattern
   - Critique uses "constructively skeptical" pattern

3. **Meeting Progression:**
   - Later meetings have MORE content, not MORE prompt
   - Use topic prioritization instead of exhaustive coverage

## Success Metrics

After fixes, we should achieve:

- **Target:** 20+ prompts (83%) in optimal 1000-1500 char range
- **Acceptable:** Remaining 4 in 800-1700 char range
- **Zero:** Files >2000 chars or <800 chars

## Fixing Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Meetings 3-4)

Focus on the 7 worst offenders first:

1. Meeting 4 Deep Dive Longer (13,012 → 1400 target)
2. Meeting 3 Deep Dive Longer (11,689 → 1400 target)
3. Meeting 4 Critique (8,088 → 1300 target)
4. Meeting 4 Deep Dive Default (8,059 → 1200 target)
5. Meeting 3 Critique (6,942 → 1300 target)
6. Meeting 3 Debate (6,495 → 1300 target)
7. Meeting 4 Debate (6,099 → 1300 target)

**Approach:**
- Remove all sub-bullet details
- Keep only section headers and 1-2 key points per section
- Use "Cover X topics" instead of explaining each topic
- Remove all examples (sources provide those)

### Phase 2: Moderate Fixes (Meeting 2-3)

Fix the 9 files in 2000-5000 char range:

- Meeting 2 Critique (3,950 → 1300)
- Meeting 2 Deep Dive Default (2,842 → 1200)
- Meeting 2 Debate (2,731 → 1300)
- Meeting 3 Deep Dive Default (2,721 → 1200)
- Meeting 4 Deep Dive Shorter (2,766 → 1100)
- Meeting 1 Critique (2,193 → 1300)
- Meeting 1 Debate (2,054 → 1300)
- Meeting 1 Deep Dive Longer (2,051 → 1400)
- Meeting 3 Deep Dive Shorter (2,035 → 1100)

**Approach:**
- Consolidate similar points
- Remove redundant explanations
- Tighten wording

### Phase 3: Minor Fixes

1. **Expand Short Prompts (3 files):**
   - Meeting 1 Deep Dive Default (507 → 1200)
   - Meeting 1 Deep Dive Shorter (457 → 1100)
   - Meeting 2 Deep Dive Longer (533 → 1400)

2. **Trim Slightly Long (2 files):**
   - Meeting 2 Brief (1855 → 1400)
   - Meeting 2 Deep Dive Shorter (1768 → 1200)

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Phase 1: Fix 7 critical files (>5000 chars)
- [ ] Phase 2: Fix 9 moderate files (2000-5000 chars)
- [ ] Phase 3: Fix 5 minor files (<1000 or 1500-2000)
- [ ] Verify all 24 files in 1000-1500 range
- [ ] Run character count validation
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Test sample prompts in NotebookLM
- [ ] Document changes in git commit

## Testing Plan

After fixes:

1. **Character Count Validation:**
   ```bash
   python3 /tmp/count_prompts.py
   # Verify all in 1000-1500 range
   ```

2. **Structure Validation:**
   - All have TARGET AUDIENCE
   - All have SOURCE FOCUS
   - All have FORMAT & LENGTH
   - All have TOPICS
   - All have DISCUSSION PREPARATION

3. **NotebookLM Testing:**
   - Test 1 prompt from each meeting
   - Verify output quality maintained
   - Confirm prompts work within NotebookLM limits

## Conclusion

This audit reveals systematic prompt verbosity issues, particularly in Meetings 3-4. The root cause is attempting to include too much detail in prompts rather than trusting uploaded sources. The fix requires aggressive condensation while maintaining structural best practices.

The brief format prompts (1359, 1260, 1428 chars) demonstrate the optimal pattern and should serve as templates for fixing other formats.
