# Accelerate DevEx Book Club Roadmap

_Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations_

**Duration:** 2 Months | **Format:** 4 Biweekly 1-Hour Sessions | **Theme-Based Structure**

## Overview

This book club follows the book's own principle of breaking work into small, manageable chunks with a steady, regular pace that allows for deep understanding and practical application. Each session focuses on core themes that build upon each other, culminating in actionable insights for improving developer experience.

## Biweekly Meeting Structure

**Rationale:** This cadence provides ample time for reflection, small experiments between meetings, and embodies the "acting your way into a better culture" approach the book advocates.

## Meeting Schedule

### Meeting 1: Laying the Foundation â€“ The Myth and the Measurement

Leadership's role in enabling and sustaining transformation.

- **Core Focus:** Transformational leadership, ING Netherlands case study, making it your own

## Success Metrics for Book Club

At the end of this 2-month journey, participants should be able to:

- âœ… **Articulate and explain** the four DORA metrics and their current team performance
- âœ… **Identify specific bottlenecks** and improvement opportunities using the 24 capabilities framework
- âœ… **Actively implement** action items from sessions with measurement
- âœ… **Understand culture's impact** on technical performance using the Westrum model
- âœ… **Have a concrete transformation plan** with small experiments and regular reflection

---

## Discussion Best Practices

- **Create Psychological Safety:** Ensure safe space for sharing deployment pain and culture challenges
- **Focus on Learning:** Approach with curiosity about what works, not judgment about current state
- **Action Orientation:** Connect every insight to specific, measurable next steps
- **Evidence-Based:** Reference the book's research findings, not just opinions
- **Inclusive Participation:** Welcome all experience levels and roles (not just engineers)

**Remember:** This isn't about copying other organizations' practices, but developing your own capabilities through experimentation and learning. As the ING case study shows: "You have to understand why, not just copy the behaviors."
