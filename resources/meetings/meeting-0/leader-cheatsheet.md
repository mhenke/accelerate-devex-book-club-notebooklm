## Quick Reference (1 Page)

### Top 3 Key Messages

1. **This Is Evidence-Based, Not Opinion**
   - 4+ years of research, 23,000+ survey responses
   - Applies across industries and contexts
   - Focus on capabilities, not maturity levels

2. **Small Batches, Steady Pace**
   - Biweekly meetings give time to read and experiment
   - Action-oriented: try small changes between meetings
   - Embodies the book's own advice on continuous improvement

3. **Culture Through Action**
   - Don't copy practices—develop your own capabilities
   - "Act your way to better culture" through experimentation
   - Focus on the virtuous cycle: technical systems ↔ team culture

### Central Framing Question to Introduce

**"How can we build a virtuous cycle where improving our _technical systems_ enhances our _team culture_, and where an improved culture, in turn, accelerates our ability to deliver value and achieve better outcomes?"**

This question connects all four meetings and reflects the book's core argument that technical practices, cultural norms, and organizational performance are mutually reinforcing.

### Common Questions & Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "What if I fall behind on reading?" | Come anyway! Discussions are theme-based. You'll still get value. |
| "Do I need a technical background?" | No! This book is for anyone in software delivery—engineers, managers, product, QA, etc. |
| "How much time between meetings?" | 2-3 hours total every two weeks: reading (~1.5-2 hrs) + optional activities (~30-60 min) |
| "Can I invite others mid-way?" | [Your answer—typically yes, with catch-up resources] |
| "What about after 2 months?" | We have extension resources: working groups, related readings, implementation plans |

### Icebreaker / Opening Question

**"In one sentence, what do you hope to learn or change about your team's software delivery practices?"**

This helps participants articulate their personal goals and creates buy-in from the start.

### Time-Saving Tips

✅ **Do:**

- Emphasize action-orientation over passive reading
- Build excitement about evidence-based transformation
- Clearly state Meeting 1 preparation requirements

⚠️ **Don't:**
- Get bogged down in logistics (send follow-up email)
- Try to teach book content (that's for Meeting 1)
- Let skeptics dominate Q&A (acknowledge, then redirect)
- Skip the virtuous cycle introduction—it's the thread connecting everything

### Key Quotes to Reference

> "You have to understand why, not just copy the behaviors." — ING Case Study

> "The key to successful change is to focus on building capabilities."

> "This isn't about copying other companies' practices—it's about developing your own capabilities through experimentation and learning."

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Set Clear Expectations**
   - Biweekly commitment, 1-hour meetings, 2-3 hours prep
   - Reading is important but discussion is valuable even without it
   - Between-meeting experiments are encouraged

2. **Establish Psychological Safety Early**
   - This is a learning environment, not performance evaluation
   - All roles are welcome and valued
   - Sharing challenges openly helps everyone learn

3. **Create Excitement**
   - Emphasize: this research shows what actually works
   - Small improvements compound over time
   - We're going to learn together and improve as we go

4. **Make Prep Clear**
   - Specific homework before Meeting 1
   - Where to find resources
   - Who to contact with questions

### Pivoting Strategies

**If group is skeptical about applicability:**
→ Acknowledge: "Research covered 2,000+ organizations across all industries"

**If someone dominates with complaints:**
→ "Great topic for Meeting 1. Let's capture that and come back to it with evidence."

**If running short on time:**
→ Skip detailed Q&A, send follow-up email with FAQs and preparation checklist

**If running over:**
→ Shorten format explanation, focus on preparation checklist and virtuous cycle concept
