### **3. How to Get the Most Out of This** (5 min)

**Discussion Best Practices:**

✅ **Psychological Safety**: Share challenges openly—no judgment  
✅ **Curiosity Over Criticism**: Learn what works, don't critique what doesn't  
✅ **Action-Oriented**: Every insight → specific next step  
✅ **Evidence-Based**: Reference research findings  
✅ **Inclusive**: All roles welcome (not just engineers!)

**Between-Meeting Activities:**

- Try small experiments from each session
- Track observations in your work
- Complete optional assessments (provided)

**The Golden Rule:**
This isn't about copying other companies' practices—it's about developing **your own capabilities** through experimentation and learning.
