The Central Question

    How can we build a virtuous cycle where improving our technical systems enhances our team culture?
    And where improved culture accelerates our ability to deliver value and achieve better outcomes?
    This reflects the book's core: technical practices, cultural norms, and organizational performance are mutually reinforcing
