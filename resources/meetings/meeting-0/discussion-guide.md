# Meeting 0 Discussion Guide

**Kickoff Meeting – Setting the Foundation**

## Central Framing Question for the Entire Book Club

> **See [Key Questions - Overall Framing](../../key-questions.md#overall)**

**"How can we build a virtuous cycle where improving our _technical systems_ enhances our _team culture_, and where an improved culture, in turn, accelerates our ability to deliver value and achieve better outcomes?"**

This question serves as the thread connecting all four meetings. It reflects the book's core argument that technical practices, cultural norms, and organizational performance are not separate domains but are mutually reinforcing.

You'll revisit this question throughout the 2-month journey, seeing how:
- **Meeting 1** explores how we measure performance and culture
- **Meeting 2** examines technical practices that enable both speed and stability
- **Meeting 3** focuses on management practices that make work sustainable
- **Meeting 4** discusses leadership that supports transformation

## Open Discussion Questions for Kickoff

### Understanding Current Context

**On Your Team's Performance:**
1. How would you describe your team's current software delivery performance?
2. What metrics (if any) does your organization use to measure this performance?
3. Are you satisfied with those metrics? Why or why not?
4. What's your biggest pain point in delivering software to production?

**On Deployment Practices:**
5. On a scale of 1-10, how anxious are you before a production deployment?
6. What factors contribute to that anxiety?
7. How often does your team deploy to production? (Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Less?)
8. What prevents more frequent deployments?

**On Team Culture:**
9. How would you describe your team's culture in three words?
10. When something goes wrong in production, what typically happens?
11. How freely does information flow in your organization?
12. Do people feel safe raising concerns or bringing bad news?

### Exploring Expectations

**On This Book Club:**
13. What do you hope to learn from reading _Accelerate_?
14. What specific outcome would make this book club "successful" for you?
15. What concerns or skepticism do you have about applying research findings to your context?
16. What's one concrete change you'd like to see in your team's practices after 2 months?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Why is that important to you?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "What obstacles might we face?"

### Real-World Scenarios to Consider

**Scenario 1: The Trade-Off Assumption**
Your manager believes the team must choose between "moving fast" or "maintaining stability." They're pushing to slow down deployments to reduce production incidents. What assumptions underlie this belief?

**Discussion points:**
- Is this trade-off real or perceived?
- What evidence would challenge this assumption?
- How might we test this in our context?

**Scenario 2: The Metrics Debate**
Leadership wants to track individual developer productivity using lines of code, story points, or tickets closed. How do you feel about this approach?

**Discussion points:**
- What behaviors might these metrics encourage?
- What outcomes do we really care about?
- What alternative metrics might better reflect value delivery?

**Scenario 3: The Culture Challenge**
You hear colleagues say: "Our culture is just the way it is. We can't change it without changing leadership or replacing people." How would you respond?

**Discussion points:**
- Can culture be changed without changing people?
- What role do practices and systems play in shaping culture?
- What's one small thing we could change to shift culture?

### Team Self-Reflection

**Current State Assessment:**
17. What practices are we proud of as a team?
18. What practices cause the most frustration or pain?
19. Where do we have the most room for improvement?
20. What constraints or obstacles limit our ability to improve?

**Aspirations:**
21. What would "high performance" look like for our team?
22. How would we know if we were improving?
23. What would it feel like to work on a "high-performing" team?
24. What's preventing us from being that team today?

### Commitment and Preparation

**Personal Commitment:**
25. What's your personal goal for this book club experience?
26. What level of engagement are you committing to? (Reading? Discussions? Experiments?)
27. What support do you need to participate fully?
28. What might prevent you from engaging, and how can we address that?

**Between-Meeting Activities:**
29. Are you willing to try small experiments between meetings?
30. How will you track observations and insights?
31. What assessment or baseline data should we gather before Meeting 1?
32. Who else in your organization should be involved in this conversation?

## Using This Discussion Guide

### For Facilitators

This kickoff is about **building context and excitement**, not teaching content. Use these questions to:

- **Start with current state** to ground the discussion in shared experience
- **Surface pain points** that the book will address
- **Build curiosity** about evidence-based practices
- **Set expectations** for active participation and experimentation
- **Introduce the virtuous cycle** as the central theme

**Key facilitation tips:**
- Don't try to answer all questions—note them for future meetings
- Use scenarios to make abstract concepts concrete
- Encourage specificity over generalizations
- Reference the virtuous cycle question often
- Close with clear preparation requirements for Meeting 1

### For Participants

Use this guide to prepare for the kickoff by:

- **Reflecting on your current context** before the meeting
- **Identifying specific examples** from your work experience
- **Formulating questions** you hope the book will answer
- **Considering your commitment** to the 2-month journey

**Come prepared to:**
- Share one deployment pain point or challenge
- Describe your team's culture in concrete terms
- Articulate what you hope to learn
- Commit to preparation before Meeting 1

### Time Management

Since this is a 30-minute meeting, select **8-10 questions maximum**:

- **Understanding Context (10 min):** Questions 1-6
- **Exploring Expectations (8 min):** Questions 13-16 or 1 scenario
- **Commitment (7 min):** Questions 25-27
- **Wrap-up (5 min):** Preparation checklist

## Connection to the Virtuous Cycle

As you discuss these questions, notice how they already point to the interconnection between technical systems and culture:

- **Technical systems:** Deployment practices, metrics, automation, testing
- **Team culture:** Psychological safety, information flow, response to failure
- **Performance outcomes:** Speed, stability, satisfaction, business results

The book will show us how these elements reinforce each other—for better or worse—and how we can intentionally build a virtuous cycle of improvement.
