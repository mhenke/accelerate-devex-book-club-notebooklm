# Meeting 4 Attendee Guide
**Leadership, Research Methods & Transformation** | Week 7 | Chapters 11, 16, Conclusion | 1 Hour

## The Culminating Question
> **"What is the single smallest change we can make that would make our next deployment just a tiny bit less painful?"**

This IS the transformation starting point. Embodies: **start small** (incremental), **focus on pain** (deployment as system health proxy), **act into culture** (behavior before beliefs), **measure and iterate** (continuous improvement).

**Your answer:** ________________________________________________________________
**Who needs involvement:** ________________________________________________________________
**First step:** ________________________________________________________________  **When:** ___________

## The 5 Characteristics of Transformational Leadership

| Characteristic | Definition | Rating (1-10) | Example from Your Experience |
|----------------|------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| **1. Vision** | Clear understanding of where org is going, can articulate 5-year future | _____ | ________________ |
| **2. Inspirational Communication** | Inspires and motivates, even in uncertain environments | _____ | ________________ |
| **3. Intellectual Stimulation** | Challenges to think differently, encourages questioning assumptions | _____ | ________________ |
| **4. Supportive Leadership** | Demonstrates care for personal needs and feelings, creates safety | _____ | ________________ |
| **5. Personal Recognition** | Praises achievements, recognizes improvements, celebrates successes | _____ | ________________ |

## Leadership's Measurable Impact

| Measure | Variance Explained |
|---------|-------------------|
| Job satisfaction | 18-23% |
| Organizational commitment | 18-23% |
| Trust in supervisor | 42% |
| Leader-member exchange quality | 50% |

**Critical Insight:** "Good leader affects team's ability to deliver code, architect systems, apply Lean principles → measurable impact on profitability, productivity, market share."
**Important:** Leadership helps but isn't enough. Need: suitable architecture, good technical practices, Lean principles, all 24 capabilities.

## Leadership vs. Management

| Leaders Do | Managers Do |
|------------|-------------|
| Create & communicate vision | Remove blockers |
| Inspire & motivate | Provide resources |
| Challenge thinking | Foster respectful environment |
| Support emotionally | Invest in development |
| Recognize achievements | Give space to experiment |

**Your org:** ⬜ Strong leadership, weak mgmt ⬜ Strong mgmt, weak leadership ⬜ Both strong ⬜ Both weak
**Biggest gap:** ________________________________________________________________

## ING Netherlands Case Study

**What ING did:** Culture transformation (→ Generative) | Transformational leadership | Cross-functional autonomous teams | DevOps practices

**Critical Finding:** Understanding the **"why"** behind behaviors matters more than copying behaviors

| ING Practice | Could Work Here? | What Would Need to Change? |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Obeya rooms (visual mgmt) | | |
| Catchball (collaborative planning) | | |
| Squad-based structure | | |
| Product-oriented org | | |

**Most important lesson:** ________________________________________________________________

## Capabilities vs. Maturity Models

| Maturity Models | Capabilities Model |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Finite endpoint ("Level 5" = done) | Continuous improvement (no finish line) |
| Can "complete" transformation | Context-specific priorities |
| One-size-fits-all progression | Focus on high-impact areas |
| **Problem:** High performers never stop | **Key:** Innovative firms never declare done |

## The 24 Capabilities Framework

| Category | Count | Capabilities |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Continuous Delivery** | 8 | Version control, deployment auto, CI, trunk-based, test auto, test data, shift left security, CD |
| **Architecture** | 2 | Loosely coupled, empowered teams |
| **Product & Process** | 4 | Customer feedback, value stream visibility, small batches, team experimentation |
| **Lean Mgmt & Monitor** | 5 | Change approval, monitoring, proactive notification, WIP limits, visualizing work |
| **Cultural** | 5 | Westrum culture, supporting learning, collaboration, job satisfaction, transformational leadership |

### Your Capabilities Assessment

| Category | Rating (1-10) | Top 2-3 Priorities | Why? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------|
| Continuous Delivery | _____ | 1. ____________ | ____________ |
| Architecture | _____ | 2. ____________ | ____________ |
| Product & Process | _____ | 3. ____________ | ____________ |
| Lean Management | _____ | | |
| Cultural | _____ | | |

## Key Research Conclusions

**1. Software Delivery Impacts Organizational Performance**
- Commercial & non-commercial outcomes | Speed + stability together (no trade-off) | Quality + speed reinforce

**2. Agile, Lean, DevOps Practices Work**
- Impact delivery AND organizational performance | Evidence shows causality, not just correlation

**3. Capabilities Over Maturity Models**
- Support continuous improvement | No "done" state | Context-specific priorities

**Executive Awareness Gap:** Executives often think further along than reality
**Do you see this?** ⬜ Yes ⬜ No ⬜ Somewhat **Example:** ________________
**What metrics/transparency would close gap?** ________________________________________________________________

## The Accelerate Roadmap

| Step | Actions | Your Application |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **1. Measure** | Implement DORA metrics, assess 24 capabilities, identify gaps | ________________ |
| **2. Focus** | Choose 2-3 capabilities, start with high-impact achievable | 1.______ 2.______ 3.______ |
| **3. Improve** | Implement practices, measure DORA impact, learn and adjust | First experiment: ________________ |
| **4. Repeat** | Continuous cycle, never declare "complete", keep raising bar | Entry point: ________________ |

## The Virtuous Cycle

**Technical Practices** (CI/CD, automation, architecture) → **Faster, safer delivery** → **Less deployment pain/stress** → **Better job satisfaction/culture** → **More experimentation/learning** → **Better technical practices** → *Cycle repeats*

**Your entry point:** ________________________________________________________________
**First action:** ________________________________________________________________

## Key Statistics

| Metric | High vs. Low Performers |
|--------|------------------------|
| Deployment frequency | **46x** more |
| Lead time | **440x** faster |
| Recovery time | **24x** faster |
| Change fail rate | **5x** lower |
| Time on new work | **49%** vs. 38% (with CD) |
| Unplanned work | **22%** less time |

## Myths Busted (Entire Book)

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| Speed and stability trade off | High performers excel at BOTH. Speed depends on stability |
| CABs improve stability | Negatively correlated with performance, NO stability correlation |
| Architecture type determines performance | Loose coupling matters more than monolith vs. microservices |
| Feature branches improve quality | Long branches reduce frequency and increase risk |
| Individual resilience solves burnout | Toxic workplace = 60% burnout. Need systemic solutions |
| Leadership is "soft skills" | Measurably impacts profitability, productivity, market share |
| Transformation has endpoint | High performers continuously improve. Never declare "done" |
