## Meeting Overview

Today we explore:
- The 5 characteristics of transformational leadership that drive performance
- Why leadership explains 18-50% of variance in job satisfaction
- The ING Netherlands case study: real-world transformation in action
- Why capabilities beat maturity models for continuous improvement
- The culminating question that ties everything together

---

## The Culminating Question

> **"What is the single smallest change we can make that would make our next deployment just a tiny bit less painful?"**

This IS the transformation starting point. This question embodies the entire philosophy: **start small** (incremental), **focus on pain** (deployment as system health proxy), **act your way into better culture** (behavior before beliefs), **measure and iterate** (continuous improvement). Answer this precisely.

## Leadership's Measurable Impact

### Key Statistics

**Transformational leadership explains:**
- **18-23%** of variance in job satisfaction
- **18-23%** of variance in organizational commitment
- **42%** of variance in trust in supervisor
- **50%** of variance in leader-member exchange quality

### Why Leadership Matters

**Critical Insight:** "A good leader affects a team's ability to deliver code, architect good systems, and apply Lean principles to how the team manages its work and develops products, all of which have a measurable impact on an organization's profitability, productivity, and market share."

**Important:** Leadership helps, but isn't enough alone. Leaders need:
- Teams executing work on suitable architecture
- Good technical practices in place
- Use of Lean principles
- All 24 capabilities functioning

**Why:** Even high-performing teams may burn out without leadership support.

---

## Leadership vs. Management

### What Leaders Do

**Leaders:**
- Create and communicate vision
- Inspire and motivate
- Challenge thinking
- Support people emotionally
- Recognize achievements

### What Managers Do

**Managers:**
- Remove blockers and impediments
- Provide resources and tools
- Foster respectful environment
- Invest in employee development
- Give space to experiment

**Your organization needs both.** Check which you see more of:

- Strong leadership, weak management
- Strong management, weak leadership
- Both strong
- Both weak

**What's the biggest gap?**

## The ING Netherlands Case Study

### Transformation Elements

**What ING did:**
1. **Culture transformation** - Moved toward generative (Westrum) culture
2. **Leadership approach** - Applied transformational leadership principles
3. **Teamwork restructuring** - Created cross-functional, autonomous teams
4. **DevOps practices** - Implemented technical and process capabilities

### Key Lessons

**Critical Finding:** Understanding the **"why"** behind behaviors matters more than copying the behaviors themselves.

**Examples of ING practices:**
- Obeya rooms (visual management spaces)
- Catchball (collaborative planning process)
- Squad-based structure (autonomous teams)
- Product-oriented organization

**What practices could work in your context?**

| ING Practice | Could It Work Here? | What Would Need to Change? |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Obeya rooms  |                     |                           |
| Catchball    |                     |                           |
| Squads       |                     |                           |
| Product orgs |                     |                           |

**Most important lesson from ING:**

## Capabilities vs. Maturity Models

### Why Maturity Models Are Problematic

**Maturity models suggest:**
- Finite endpoint ("Level 5" = done)
- You can "complete" transformation
- One-size-fits-all progression

**Problem:** High performers never stop improving. They don't declare transformation "done."

### The Capabilities Model

**Capabilities model emphasizes:**
- Continuous improvement (no finish line)
- Context-specific priorities
- Focus on high-impact areas
- Ongoing evolution

**Key Insight:** "Innovative firms never declare transformation complete."

---

## The 24 Capabilities Framework

### Five Categories

**1. Continuous Delivery (8 capabilities)**
- Version control, deployment automation, CI, trunk-based development
- Test automation, test data management, shift left on security, continuous delivery

**2. Architecture (2 capabilities)**
- Loosely coupled architecture
- Empowered teams

**3. Product and Process (4 capabilities)**
- Customer feedback, value stream visibility
- Working in small batches, team experimentation

**4. Lean Management and Monitoring (5 capabilities)**
- Change approval processes, monitoring, proactive notification
- WIP limits, visualizing work

**5. Cultural (5 capabilities)**
- Westrum organizational culture, supporting learning
- Collaboration among teams, job satisfaction
- Transformational leadership

---

## Your Capabilities Assessment

## The Transformation Journey

### Key Research Conclusions

**1. Software Delivery Impacts Organizational Performance**
- Both commercial and non-commercial outcomes
- Speed and stability improve together (no trade-off)
- Quality and speed reinforce each other

**2. Practices from Agile, Lean, and DevOps Work**
- When done right, they impact delivery AND organizational performance
- Evidence shows causal links, not just correlation

**3. Capabilities Over Maturity Models**
- Support continuous improvement
- No "done" state
- Context-specific priorities

### The Executive Awareness Gap

**Critical Finding:** Executives often think they're **further along** the transformation journey than those on the ground.

**Do you see this gap?** Yes / No / Somewhat

**Example:**

________________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________

**What metrics or transparency would close the gap?**

________________________________________________________________

- Assess current state of 24 capabilities
- Identify gaps and opportunities

**Your current measurement:**

________________________________________________________________

### Step 2: Focus

## Myths Busted (Entire Book)

### Myth: Speed and stability trade off
**Reality:** High performers excel at BOTH simultaneously. Speed depends on stability.

### Myth: CABs improve stability
**Reality:** CABs negatively correlated with performance, no correlation with stability.

### Myth: Architecture type determines performance
**Reality:** Loose coupling matters more than monolith vs. microservices.

### Myth: Feature branches improve quality
**Reality:** Long branches reduce deployment frequency and increase risk.

### Myth: Individual resilience solves burnout
**Reality:** Toxic workplace predicts 60% of burnout. Need systemic solutions.

### Myth: Leadership is "soft skills"
**Reality:** Leadership measurably impacts profitability, productivity, market share.

### Myth: Transformation has an endpoint
**Reality:** High performers continuously improve. Never declare "done."
