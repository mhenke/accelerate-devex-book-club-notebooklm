# ING Case Study: Real-World Transformation

**How a global financial institution transformed through learning, leadership, and patient discipline**

---

## 🏦 The Transformation Challenge

ING Netherlands faced a seemingly impossible task: transform a large, traditional financial institution—with all its regulations, legacy systems, and established culture—into a high-performing organization capable of competing with digital-native companies.

**The achievement:** ING successfully transformed by having leaders become a learning team and empowering cross-functional squads to own outcomes. Their story proves large, complex organizations CAN transform.

---

## 💡 Why the ING Case Study Matters

### The Common Belief

**Typical assumptions about transformation:**
- Only small startups can be agile
- Regulations prevent rapid iteration
- Legacy systems lock in slow delivery
- Cultural change takes decades
- Must follow a prescriptive framework

**The problem:** These assumptions become self-fulfilling prophecies.

### The ING Reality

**What ING proved:**
- Large, regulated organizations CAN transform
- Legacy systems can coexist with modern practices
- Cultural change comes from changing work
- Leaders must become learners
- Context matters more than copying practices

**Why it matters:** If ING can do it, others can too—with the right approach.

## 🎯 The ING Transformation Approach

### Three Interconnected Practices

ING didn't copy anyone's transformation playbook. They developed practices that fit their context:

#### 1. Obeya Rooms: Visual Strategy Management

**What they are:**
- Japanese term meaning "big room"
- Physical spaces dedicated to strategic objectives
- Visual displays of goals, progress, gaps, problems
- Regular gathering place for leadership teams
- Transparent performance tracking

**How ING used them:**
- Each leadership team had obeya room
- Strategic objectives visible on walls
- Performance metrics updated continuously
- Problems and blockers displayed prominently
- Teams gathered regularly to review and adjust

**Why this worked:**
- Made strategy concrete and visible
- Exposed gaps between goals and reality
- Forced honest conversation about problems
- Created shared understanding across leaders
- Enabled rapid response to issues

**Key insight:** "You can't improve what you can't see"

---

#### 2. Catchball Communication: Multi-Directional Flow

**What it is:**
- Japanese lean practice for policy deployment
- Information flows vertically AND horizontally
- Goals "caught" and refined at each level
- Feedback flows back up the organization
- Rapid learning cycles

**How ING used it:**
- Strategic objectives cascade down
- Teams provide reality check and feedback
- Goals adjusted based on ground truth
- Learning shared horizontally across teams
- Continuous refinement of approach

**Why this worked:**
- Prevented top-down dictates disconnected from reality
- Leveraged frontline team knowledge
- Built buy-in through participation
- Enabled fast course correction
- Spread learning across organization

**Key insight:** "Policy isn't deployed—it's developed together"

---

#### 3. BizDevOps Squads: Empowered Ownership

**What they are:**
- Cross-functional teams (business, dev, ops)
- "Two pizza rule" sizing (6-10 people)
- Organized into Tribes (collections of squads)
- End-to-end product ownership
- Full authority to make decisions

**How ING used it:**
- Reorganized entire IT organization
- Business analysts embedded in squads
- Operations engineers in squads (not separate)
- Squads own features from idea to production
- Tribes aligned to business domains

**Why this worked:**
- Eliminated handoffs and delays
- Built deep product expertise
- Enabled rapid iteration
- Created accountability and ownership
- Fostered collaboration over coordination

**Key insight:** "Organize for outcomes, not activities"

## 🚧 Common Obstacles & Solutions

### "We Can't Reorganize Teams"

**Problem:** Organizational resistance to restructuring

**Solution:**
- Start with pilot teams
- Prove value through results
- Use data to justify expansion
- Respect constraints while pushing boundaries
- Virtual teams if physical reorganization blocked

**ING example:** They DID reorganize—but only after building leadership alignment.

---

### "Our Regulations Are Different"

**Problem:** Belief that regulations prevent transformation

**Solution:**
- ING is highly regulated (financial services)
- Compliance through automation and documentation
- Separation of concerns (not people)
- Continuous compliance, not point-in-time
- Partner with compliance teams

**ING example:** Used deployment automation to prove compliance continuously.

---

### "Leadership Won't Commit"

**Problem:** Lack of senior leadership support

**Solution:**
- Start where you have support
- Show results with pilot teams
- Use data to demonstrate impact
- Build coalition of supporters
- Be patient and persistent

**ING example:** CEO-led transformation—seek executive sponsor or build case upward.

---

### "We Need Results Faster"

**Problem:** Pressure for quick wins

**Solution:**
- Accept that transformation takes time
- Celebrate small improvements
- Show momentum through metrics
- Manage expectations with leadership
- Focus on sustainable change, not theater

**ING example:** Multi-year transformation accepted from start.
