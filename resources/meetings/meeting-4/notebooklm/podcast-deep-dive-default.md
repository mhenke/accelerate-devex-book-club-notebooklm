## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
Assume listener is leader/practitioner. Focus Ch 11,16,Conclusion Accelerate. Create 15-20min: (1) Five Leadership Characteristics - vision, inspirational communication, intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership, personal recognition - explains 18-50% variance in satisfaction/commitment, 42% trust, leaders ENABLE practices (don't directly improve DORA), high performers 2.2x exceed goals, (2) ING Netherlands case - Obeya rooms (visual strategy spaces with catchball for vertical info flow), autonomous squads with coaching culture, CEO commitment critical, transformation required cultural not just technical change, (3) CULMINATING QUESTION: "What single smallest change would make next deployment less painful?" - this IS the starting point, (4) 30-60-90 day roadmap beginning with that question, small experiments compound, (5) Capabilities model (continuous improvement, context-specific) vs maturity models (finite endpoint, prescriptive, dangerous "we're done" mentality). Key: transformation journey not destination, focus on impactful capabilities not "completeness". Discuss: Which leadership characteristics YOUR leaders exhibit? ING practices adaptable to YOUR context? YOUR answer to culminating question? How sustain momentum beyond 90 days?
