## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
Assume listener is skeptical. Focus Ch 11,16,Conclusion Accelerate. Create 15-20min critical: (1) Leadership causation (correlation vs causation? Survivorship bias? Founder vs hired leaders?), (2) ING uniqueness (CEO commitment rare, years not months, Dutch context, size/resources), (3) Transformation reality (resistance, time, cost, backsliding). Discuss: when leadership doesn't help, ING applicability, realistic timeline.
