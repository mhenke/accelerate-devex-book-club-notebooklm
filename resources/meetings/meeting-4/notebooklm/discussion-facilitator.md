## Prep Questions for Attendees (Share Before Meeting)

**Send this section to participants 24 hours before the meeting to help them prepare Join questions.**

### Getting Ready to Join the Discussion

During Meeting 4, we'll use NotebookLM's **Join feature** to ask the AI podcast hosts questions about YOUR specific context. Come prepared with 1-2 questions from the prompts below:

#### About Transformational Leadership (Chapter 11)

**Preparation prompts:**
- Do your leaders provide a vision that inspires and motivates?
- Do your leaders give teams "air cover" to experiment and take risks?
- Do your leaders encourage intellectual stimulation (challenging assumptions)?
- Do leaders recognize individual contributions and provide personal support?
- Do leaders demonstrate the behaviors they expect from others?

**Good Join questions to ask the hosts:**
- "Our leaders set OKRs but don't provide air cover when experiments fail. What does the research say about this?"
- "Leadership says they want innovation but punishes failures. How does this affect transformation?"
- "What's the difference between transactional and transformational leadership in practice?"
- "How do the five characteristics of transformational leadership work together?"

#### About the 24 Capabilities (Chapter 16)

**Preparation prompts:**
- Looking at the 24 capabilities, which ones is your organization strongest at?
- Which capabilities would have the biggest impact if improved?
- How many capabilities does your organization have in place?
- Are you trying to improve all capabilities at once, or focusing on a few?

**Good Join questions to ask the hosts:**
- "We have [number] of 24 capabilities. Where should we start?"
- "Should we focus on continuous delivery capabilities first, or lean management?"
- "How are the 24 capabilities organized? Are there dependencies?"
- "Can we achieve high performance without implementing all 24 capabilities?"

#### About Transformation & ING Case Study (Chapter 16 & Conclusion)

**Preparation prompts:**
- What was most surprising about ING's transformation approach?
- How did ING organize teams around customer needs rather than functions?
- What barriers to transformation exist in your organization?
- Who are the transformation champions in your organization?

**Good Join questions to ask the hosts:**
- "ING reorganized into squads and tribes. Do we need to copy their structure?"
- "Our organization is resistant to change. How did ING overcome resistance?"
- "What role did leadership play in ING's transformation success?"
- "How long did ING's transformation take? What should we expect?"

#### About Your Transformation Journey

**Preparation prompts:**
- Reflecting on all four meetings, which capability or practice will you champion?
- What's the smallest change you could make that would have the biggest impact?
- Who needs to be involved in your transformation efforts?
- What will you measure to track progress?

**Good Join questions to ask the hosts:**
- "We want to start our transformation. Should we begin with technical practices or management practices?"
- "How do we make the case to leadership for investing in these capabilities?"
- "What's the minimum viable transformation - the smallest set of capabilities to start with?"
- "How do we sustain momentum after this book club ends?"

### How to Craft Good Join Questions

**✅ DO:**
- Ask about YOUR specific context
- Include relevant details (current leadership style, capability gaps, transformation barriers)
- Challenge assumptions with real examples
- Request clarification on research findings
- Connect concepts from all four meetings

**❌ DON'T:**
- Ask generic questions already covered in the podcast
- Ask for opinions ("What do you think about...?")
- Request information not in the uploaded sources
- Ask multiple questions at once

### During the Meeting

1. Listen to the hosts cover each topic
2. When the facilitator pauses and asks for Join questions, raise your hand if you prepared one
3. When called on, press Join and wait for the host to invite you
4. Ask your prepared question clearly and concisely
5. Listen to the host's response and the subsequent discussion

**Remember:** The AI hosts are responding based on chapters 11, 16, and Conclusion of Accelerate and any additional sources uploaded. Their answers are grounded in the research, not opinions.

## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Create audio overview for Meeting 4 (Ch 11, 16, Conclusion of Accelerate) optimized for Interactive Mode with Join feature. Structure as conversational deep dive with natural pauses for listener questions: (1) Opening (2 min) - Welcome to Meeting 4, the final discussion of Accelerate. Explain we'll cover transformational leadership, the 24 capabilities framework, and how to begin transformation. Mention listeners can use Join button to ask questions about their specific context and transformation journey. (2) Transformational Leadership Deep Dive (5-6 min) - Introduce the five characteristics of transformational leaders: vision (inspirational motivation), intellectual stimulation (challenging assumptions), supportive leadership (individualized consideration), personal recognition (contingent reward), demonstrating values (idealized influence). KEY FINDING: transformational leadership strongly predicts software delivery performance, organizational performance, and employee job satisfaction. Explain how leaders provide "air cover" for teams to experiment and take calculated risks. Discuss the difference between transactional leadership (rewards/punishment) and transformational leadership (inspire/develop). Connect to culture change from Meeting 1 - leaders model the behavior they want to see. Natural transition: "Leadership enables the 24 capabilities that drive performance..." (3) The 24 Capabilities Framework (5-6 min) - Explain the 24 capabilities are organized into five categories: continuous delivery (8 capabilities including version control, CI, trunk-based dev, test automation, deployment automation, architecture, shift-left security, test data management), architecture (loosely coupled), product and process (lean management, visual management, WIP limits, customer feedback, team experimentation, working in small batches, approval processes), lean management and monitoring (monitoring and observability, proactive notifications, WIP limits, visual displays), and cultural capabilities (Westrum generative culture, learning culture, job satisfaction). KEY STAT: organizations don't need all 24 capabilities to be high performers, but the more capabilities adopted, the better the outcomes. Discuss how capabilities work together - for example, trunk-based development requires test automation, which requires CI. Natural transition: "Let's look at how ING applied these capabilities..." (4) ING Transformation Case Study (4-5 min) - Discuss ING's transformation: reorganized from functional silos into cross-functional "squads" (8-10 people) and "tribes" (multiple squads around customer journey). KEY CHANGES: moved from project to product mindset, empowered teams with autonomy, created internal platform teams to reduce friction, focused on customer outcomes not technical outputs. Explain transformation took 3 years with strong executive support. Connect back to Conway's Law (Meeting 2) - ING organized teams to create desired loosely coupled architecture. Discuss critical success factors: executive sponsorship, clear vision, empowered teams, incremental rollout. (5) Beginning Your Transformation (2-3 min) - Address "where do we start?" Explain there's no single right answer - start where you have pain. If deployments are painful and cause burnout (Meeting 3), start with CD capabilities. If teams can't deploy independently (Meeting 2), start with architecture. If culture is pathological (Meeting 1), leadership must demonstrate transformational behaviors. KEY ADVICE: Don't try to change everything at once. Pick 2-3 capabilities, implement them well, measure impact, then expand. Get leadership support - transformation requires air cover. Find champions who will advocate for change. Measure progress with DORA metrics (Meeting 1). (6) Closing & Next Steps (1-2 min) - Summarize: transformational leadership + 24 capabilities + incremental approach = sustainable high performance. Encourage listeners to commit to one capability they'll champion in their organization. Mention Join is available for questions about starting their transformation journey. Keep natural conversational tone. Emphasize research findings with specific statistics. Make it clear this is based on rigorous DORA research from Accelerate, not opinions. This is the culmination of all four meetings - help listeners synthesize and apply the knowledge.

### Extended Context (For Reference - Do Not Copy to NotebookLM)

**MEETING 4 CORE QUESTION:**
"What leadership behaviors and organizational capabilities do we need to sustain our transformation, and what's the smallest meaningful change we can start with based on our current context?"

**INTERACTIVE PODCAST STRUCTURE (15-20 minutes total):**

**Opening (2 min)**
- Hosts welcome listeners to final meeting
- Set expectation: synthesizing all concepts and planning transformation

**Part 1: Transformational Leadership (6 min)**
Three questions exploring leadership:
1. "Do your leaders provide vision that inspires?" → PAUSE → Hosts explain inspirational motivation
2. "Do leaders give 'air cover' for experiments?" → PAUSE → Hosts discuss supportive leadership and risk-taking
3. "Do leaders model the behaviors they expect?" → PAUSE → Hosts connect to culture change (Meeting 1)

**Part 2: 24 Capabilities Framework (6 min)**
Two questions about capabilities:
1. "How many of 24 capabilities does your org have?" → PAUSE → Hosts explain capability categories and interdependencies
2. "Where should we start?" → PAUSE → Hosts discuss starting where you have pain

**Part 3: ING Transformation & Your Journey (5 min)**
Two questions about transformation:
1. "What surprised you about ING's approach?" → PAUSE → Hosts highlight squads/tribes and Conway's Law
2. "What's your smallest meaningful change?" → PAUSE → Hosts encourage commitment to 2-3 capabilities

**Closing Commitment (2 min)**
- "Which capability will you champion?" → PAUSE → Hosts reinforce commitment and measuring with DORA metrics

**KEY STATISTICS THE HOSTS WILL EMPHASIZE:**
- Transformational leadership predicts software delivery performance, org performance, and job satisfaction
- 24 capabilities organized in 5 categories
- Organizations don't need all 24 to be high performers
- ING transformation took 3 years with executive support
- Start with 2-3 capabilities where you have pain
- Measure progress with DORA metrics from Meeting 1

**HOW THE HOSTS RESPOND TO COMMON ANSWERS:**
- If leaders don't provide air cover → They explain supportive leadership is critical for experimentation
- If you have few capabilities → They encourage starting small, picking where pain is greatest
- If you're inspired by ING → They caution against copying structure, focus on principles
- If you're overwhelmed → They emphasize incremental approach, 2-3 capabilities at a time
- Whatever capability you choose → They affirm the choice and connect to DORA metrics

**PAUSE MECHANICS:**
- Hosts will explicitly say "We'll pause here" or "Take a moment to reflect"
- 10-second pauses give you time to think and respond
- You can pause playback for longer group discussions
- Hosts resume as if they heard typical responses

## When to Use This Format

**Best for:**
- **Leadership teams** exploring how to lead transformation
- **Transformation champions** planning where to start
- **Teams completing book club** synthesizing all concepts
- **Organizations ready to act** - can ask targeted questions about their transformation journey
- **Solo prep** - individuals can use Join to explore how to champion change

**Not ideal for:**
- **Large groups (>10 people)** - too many people wanting to Join creates wait time
- **First meeting** - this is the culmination, requires context from Meetings 1-3
- **Teams not ready to act** - this meeting is about planning transformation, not just learning

## Troubleshooting Interactive Mode Challenges

**Challenge: Join button not working**
→ Solution: This feature only works on newly generated Audio Overviews. Regenerate using the prompt above and ensure "Interactive mode (BETA)" button is visible.

**Challenge: Participants ask vague or generic questions**
→ Solution: Remind them to include specific context: "Our leaders do X but not Y..." or "We have [number] of 24 capabilities..." Give examples from the Prep Questions section.

**Challenge: AI host gives incorrect or confusing answer**
→ Solution: The feature is experimental. Pause playback, clarify with the group using the book, then continue. Note: Hosts can only reference uploaded sources.

**Challenge: Too many people want to Join at once**
→ Solution: Facilitate like a classroom - take turns, limit to 2-3 Join interactions per topic section before moving forward.

**Challenge: Participants want to discuss all 24 capabilities**
→ Solution: Focus Join questions on "where do we start?" rather than explaining every capability. Use the printed assessment for detailed review.

**Challenge: Running over time**
→ Solution: Limit Join interactions to 2 minutes each. If needed, offer to stay after for additional Join questions from interested participants.

**Challenge: Silence - no one wants to Join**
→ Solution: Call on someone who prepared questions (from the prep email). Model good Join questions yourself about transformation barriers.

---

## Why This Works Better Than Traditional Discussion

**Traditional facilitated discussion:**
- Facilitator must be expert on all 24 capabilities and transformation approaches
- Discussions become abstract about "what we should do" without commitment
- Quiet people don't participate
- Hard to synthesize four meetings worth of concepts

**Interactive Mode with Join:**
- AI hosts provide research-backed answers about leadership and capabilities consistently
- Base podcast synthesizes all four meetings before Join
- Participants prepare specific questions about THEIR transformation journey (not just "discuss")
- Join creates structured turn-taking and commitment
- Hosts ground responses in uploaded sources (chapters 11, 16, Conclusion + assessments)
- Same experience whether facilitator is transformation expert or not

**Best of both worlds:** Structure of a podcast + interactivity of discussion + research-backed responses + synthesis of all concepts + transformation planning + participatory engagement.
