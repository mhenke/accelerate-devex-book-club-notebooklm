## Core Framing Question

> **See [Key Questions - Meeting 4](../../../key-questions.md#meeting-4)**

**"What single supportive behavior could our leaders adopt to best enable team experimentation and a generative culture, and what practical steps (like the Obeya rooms or 'catchball' at ING) could we use to make that leadership support visible and effective?"**

This question synthesizes transformational leadership theory (Ch. 11) with practical case study applications (Ch. 16). It pushes discussion from abstract leadership qualities to concrete, observable actions that foster the high-trust, learning-focused environment the book describes throughout.

## Question Bank: All Options

**Instructions:** Browse questions below and select 8-10 that fit your team's context. The [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-recommended-meeting-flow) above provides a recommended selection for a typical 60-minute meeting.

### Section A: Understanding Current State

**On Current Leadership:**
1. Of the 5 transformational leadership characteristics (vision, inspirational communication, intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership, personal recognition), which is strongest in your organization? Which needs most development?
2. How often do leaders communicate a clear, inspiring vision of where the organization is going?
3. Think of the best leader you've worked with. Which of the 5 transformational leadership characteristics did they demonstrate most strongly?
4. When was the last time a leader personally recognized your work or your team's achievements?

**On Leadership Support:**
5. How do leaders in your organization respond when teams need time to fix technical debt or improve processes?
6. Do leaders remove impediments and blockers, or do teams struggle to get the resources they need?
7. Are teams empowered to make decisions about their work and tools, or does every decision require leadership approval?
8. How do leaders respond to failures or incidents? Is the focus on learning or on finding someone to blame?

**On Transformation Progress:**
9. Where is your organization in its DevOps transformation journey: just starting, making progress, highly mature, or not started?
10. How is progress measured: by specific capabilities improved, by maturity level achieved, or not measured at all?
11. Research shows transformational leadership explains 18-50% of variance in outcomes. What evidence of leadership impact do you see in your team's performance?
12. Do executives and practitioners agree on how far along the transformation is, or is there a gap in perception?

### Section B: Exploring Concepts

**On the 24 Capabilities:**
13. Looking at the 24 capabilities across 5 categories (Continuous Delivery, Architecture, Product & Process, Lean Management, Cultural), which category is your organization strongest in?
14. Which category needs the most improvement?
15. How many of the 24 capabilities have you consciously worked on in the past year?
16. What prevents your organization from improving more capabilities simultaneously?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Which capabilities would be easiest to improve?"
- "Which would have the biggest impact?"
- "What's blocking progress on capabilities?"

**On Capabilities vs. Maturity Models:**
17. Of the 24 capabilities, which 2-3 would have the highest impact if improved in your organization right now?
18. How would you measure progress on those capabilities without using a maturity model?
19. Does your organization treat DevOps transformation as a journey (continuous improvement) or a destination (maturity model)? How does that affect behavior?
20. What would it look like to "never declare transformation complete"? How would that change priorities?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What does 'done' mean for your transformation?"
- "How do high performers stay high performers?"
- "What prevents continuous improvement?"

**On Transformational Leadership in Practice:**
21. How could leaders in your organization demonstrate more "intellectual stimulation" - challenging teams to think about problems in new ways?
22. What would "supportive leadership" look like in practice for your team: more resources, removal of blockers, psychological safety, or something else?
23. How could leadership better connect individual work to organizational vision and customer outcomes?
24. The book warns against "maturity models" that suggest you can finish. What evidence do you see that transformation is viewed as ongoing or as a completable project?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What's one leadership behavior that would enable experimentation?"
- "How could recognition become more frequent and meaningful?"
- "What leadership support is most lacking?"

### Section C: Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Leadership Gap**
Your executive team believes the organization is "well along" in its DevOps transformation and is ready to declare success. However, practitioners report they still struggle with manual deployments, lack of test automation, and approval bottlenecks. Executives point to adoption of cloud infrastructure and Agile ceremonies as evidence of maturity. How do you address this perception gap?

**Discussion points:**
- What data would reveal the real state of capabilities?
- How to communicate gap without seeming negative?
- What shared metrics would align perspectives?

**Scenario 2: The Unsupportive Leader**
A team wants to spend two weeks refactoring a critical component to improve testability and reduce deployment time. Their manager denies the request, saying "we don't have time for technical work - we need to focus on features." The team's deployment frequency is monthly, and change failure rate is 40%. How do you help the manager understand the connection between technical work and delivery performance?

**Discussion points:**
- How to frame technical work as business value?
- What evidence would convince the manager?
- How to demonstrate ROI of technical improvements?

**Scenario 3: The Case Study Copycat**
Leadership reads about ING's transformation success and wants to copy their practices: adopt squads and tribes, create Obeya rooms, implement "catchball" planning. However, the organization hasn't addressed fundamental issues like lack of test automation, tightly coupled architecture, or change approval boards. What's your advice?

**Discussion points:**
- Why does copying practices without understanding "why" fail?
- What foundational capabilities must come first?
- How to learn from case studies without cargo-culting?

### Section D: Team Self-Assessment

**Transformational Leadership Assessment:**
25. Rate your organization's leadership on each characteristic (1-5 scale):
   - **Vision:** Clear understanding and communication of where we're going
   - **Inspirational Communication:** Motivating communication that creates purpose
   - **Intellectual Stimulation:** Challenging teams to think differently
   - **Supportive Leadership:** Care for team members' needs and wellbeing
   - **Personal Recognition:** Regular acknowledgment of achievements

26. Which characteristic, if improved, would have the biggest impact on your team's performance?

**Transformation Journey Assessment:**
27. Which is harder: implementing technical practices (CI/CD, automation) or changing culture (psychological safety, learning from failures)? Why?
28. How would you rate your organization's approach to transformation:
   - Focused on capabilities and continuous improvement
   - Using maturity model with defined endpoint
   - Ad-hoc improvements without clear framework
   - Not actively pursuing transformation

29. What would convince leadership to invest more in transformation?

**Capabilities Prioritization:**
30. Rank your top 3 capabilities to improve from these categories:
   - **Continuous Delivery:** Version control, automation, CI, trunk-based development, testing
   - **Architecture:** Loose coupling, team independence
   - **Product & Process:** Customer feedback, small batches, experimentation
   - **Lean Management:** WIP limits, visualization, monitoring
   - **Cultural:** Westrum culture, learning, collaboration, satisfaction, leadership

31. What's blocking progress on your top capability?

### Section E: Reflection and Commitment

**Looking Back:**
32. Do executives in your organization understand where you really are in the transformation journey? What creates that gap?
33. What leadership behavior from the ING case study would be most valuable to adopt in your organization?
34. How has your understanding of the connection between technical practices and culture changed through this book club?
35. Which chapter or concept from "Accelerate" had the biggest impact on your thinking?

**Looking Forward:**
36. If you could change one leadership behavior in your organization, what would it be and why?
37. Across all four meetings, what's the single most important insight you're taking away from "Accelerate"?
38. What capability will you personally work to improve in the next month?
39. What commitments will you make to continue this transformation journey after the book club ends?
40. What is the single smallest change we can make that would make our next deployment just a tiny bit less painful?

## Final Reflection

As you conclude this book club, remember the core insight from "Accelerate":

**Speed and stability are not trade-offs. Technical practices, cultural norms, and organizational outcomes are deeply interconnected. High performance is achievable through focus on measurable capabilities, transformational leadership, and commitment to continuous improvement.**

The research proves that investing in software delivery performance - through technical practices, Lean management, and supportive culture - directly impacts organizational performance, market share, and profitability. More importantly, it creates organizations where people want to work, where learning is celebrated, and where teams can do their best work.

**The question is not whether to transform, but how quickly you can begin.**
