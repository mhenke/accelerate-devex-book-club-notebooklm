## Meeting Outcomes

By the end of Meeting 1, participants should:
- ✅ **Understand** the four DORA metrics and what they measure
- ✅ **Recognize** that high performers achieve both speed AND stability
- ✅ **Identify** their organization's culture type using Westrum's model
- ✅ **Begin** informal tracking of at least one DORA metric
- ✅ **Commit** to observing culture behaviors before Meeting 2

## Key Concepts Covered

### The Four DORA Metrics
- **Lead Time:** Time from commit to production
- **Deployment Frequency:** How often code deploys
- **Time to Restore:** Recovery time after incidents
- **Change Fail Rate:** Percentage of deployments causing failures

### Speed + Stability (Not Speed vs. Stability)
- High performers: 46x more deployments, 440x faster lead time, 170x faster recovery
- No trade-offs: Practices that improve speed also improve stability

### Westrum's Organizational Culture Types
- **Pathological:** Power-oriented, low cooperation, messengers shot
- **Bureaucratic:** Rule-oriented, modest cooperation, messengers neglected
- **Generative:** Performance-oriented, high cooperation, messengers trained

### Deployment Pain as Signal
- Anxiety before deployments indicates process problems, not personal failure
- Fear signals pathological or bureaucratic culture
- Addressing root causes (manual processes, poor architecture) improves both performance and culture

## Action Items for Next Meeting

Before Meeting 2 (Week 3), participants should:
- ⬜ Begin informal tracking of one DORA metric
- ⬜ Identify biggest deployment pain point
- ⬜ Observe and document examples of pathological, bureaucratic, or generative culture behaviors

## Next Meeting

**[Meeting 2: Technical Excellence & Continuous Delivery](../meeting-2/)**
- Chapters 4-6
- Week 3
- Focus: Technical practices that enable high performance
