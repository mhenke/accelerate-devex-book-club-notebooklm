# Culture Assessment: Measuring Your Organizational Culture

**A practical assessment for measuring Westrum organizational culture**

---

## 📋 Purpose

This assessment helps you measure your organization's culture using Westrum's typology model. Use these Likert-scale questions to establish a baseline and track cultural improvements over time.

---

## 📖 Background: Westrum's Organizational Culture Model

Dr. Ron Westrum identified three organizational culture types that predict performance:

### Pathological (Power-Oriented)
- Low cooperation, messengers shot, responsibilities shirked, bridging discouraged, failure leads to scapegoating, novelty crushed

### Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)
- Modest cooperation, messengers neglected, narrow responsibilities, bridging tolerated, failure leads to justice, novelty leads to problems

### Generative (Performance-Oriented)
- High cooperation, messengers trained, risks are shared, bridging encouraged, failure leads to inquiry, novelty implemented

Research from "Accelerate" shows that **generative culture strongly predicts both software delivery performance and organizational performance**.

## 📊 Culture Assessment Survey

For each statement below, select the response that best describes your organization:

**Scale:**
- 1 = Strongly Disagree
- 2 = Disagree
- 3 = Somewhat Disagree
- 4 = Neither Agree nor Disagree
- 5 = Somewhat Agree
- 6 = Agree
- 7 = Strongly Agree

---

### Information Flow

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Information is actively sought.** Information is proactively shared and people actively look for information that will help them work more effectively. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **Messengers are not punished when they deliver news of failures or other bad news.** People who surface problems are valued, not blamed. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **Information is freely shared across organizational boundaries.** Teams and departments share information openly without hoarding or gatekeeping. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

---

### Collaboration & Responsibility

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Responsibilities are shared.** Teams take collective ownership of outcomes rather than pointing fingers when things go wrong. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **Cross-functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded.** Working across team boundaries is the norm, not the exception. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **Teams are encouraged to bridge between departments.** Connecting different parts of the organization is valued and supported. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

---

### Learning & Innovation

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Failure causes inquiry.** When things go wrong, we ask "what can we learn?" instead of "who is responsible?" | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **New ideas are welcomed.** Innovation and experimentation are encouraged, even if they might fail. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **Failures are treated primarily as opportunities to improve the system.** We focus on systemic improvements rather than individual blame. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

## 🧮 Scoring Your Assessment

### Calculate Your Scores

1. **Add up all your ratings** for the 9 questions
2. **Divide by 9** to get your average score

**Your Organization's Culture Score: _____ / 7**

---

### Interpreting Your Score

#### 6.0 - 7.0: Generative Culture (High Performance)
**Congratulations!** Your organization demonstrates strong generative culture characteristics.

**Strengths:**
- High cooperation and information sharing
- Messengers are valued and trained
- Shared responsibility and collective ownership
- Failure drives learning and improvement
- Innovation is welcomed and implemented

**Focus areas:**
- Sustain these practices
- Share your learnings with other teams
- Mentor teams with lower culture scores

---

#### 4.5 - 5.9: Bureaucratic-Generative Culture (Medium-High Performance)
**Good progress!** You're moving toward generative culture with some bureaucratic tendencies.

**Strengths:**
- Modest to high cooperation
- Information flows reasonably well
- Some risk-taking is tolerated
- Failure leads to process improvement

**Areas for improvement:**
- Increase active information seeking
- Reward messengers who surface problems
- Expand cross-functional collaboration
- Treat more failures as learning opportunities

---

#### 3.0 - 4.4: Bureaucratic Culture (Medium Performance)
**Opportunity for growth.** Your culture follows rules but may limit innovation and adaptability.

**Current state:**
- Modest cooperation exists
- Messengers are often neglected
- Responsibilities are compartmentalized
- Information flows through formal channels
- Failure triggers process review but may include blame

**Priority improvements:**
1. Create psychological safety for surfacing problems
2. Encourage cross-functional collaboration
3. Shift from blame to learning when failures occur
4. Actively seek and share information across boundaries

---

#### 1.0 - 2.9: Pathological-Bureaucratic Culture (Low Performance)
**Significant transformation needed.** Your culture may be limiting performance and employee satisfaction.

**Current challenges:**
- Low cooperation and information hoarding
- Messengers punished or neglected
- Responsibilities shirked or narrowly defined
- Bridging discouraged or tolerated minimally
- Failure leads to blame or narrow justice
- Novelty is crushed or seen as problematic

**Critical first steps:**
1. **Leadership commitment:** Secure executive sponsorship for culture change
2. **Psychological safety:** Make it safe to surface problems without punishment
3. **Small wins:** Start with one team practicing blameless postmortems
4. **Model behavior:** Leaders must demonstrate vulnerability and learning from failure
5. **Technical practices:** Implement version control, CI, and automated testing (these practices improve culture)

## 📈 Tracking Cultural Change Over Time

### Recommended Cadence

- **Baseline:** Complete this assessment now
- **Follow-up:** Reassess every 3-6 months
- **Track trends:** Look for improvements in specific questions, not just overall score

### What to Track

Create a simple tracking spreadsheet:

| Date | Overall Score | Info Flow | Collaboration | Learning | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Jan 2024 | 3.2 | 3.0 | 3.3 | 3.3 | Baseline before transformation |
| Apr 2024 | 3.8 | 3.7 | 4.0 | 3.7 | Implemented blameless postmortems |
| Jul 2024 | 4.5 | 4.3 | 4.7 | 4.5 | Cross-functional pairing increased |

## 🎯 Using Assessment Results

### For Teams

**If your score is low (1.0-2.9):**
1. Start with one practice: blameless postmortems
2. Create psychological safety in your team first
3. Document and share learnings from failures
4. Celebrate when people surface problems early

**If your score is medium (3.0-4.4):**
1. Expand collaboration beyond your immediate team
2. Actively seek information from other departments
3. Reward risk-taking and experimentation
4. Share information more proactively

**If your score is high (4.5-7.0):**
1. Mentor other teams on your practices
2. Share your success stories
3. Continue to deepen generative practices
4. Look for ways to scale across the organization

---

### For Leaders

**Use assessment data to:**
- Identify teams that need support
- Track transformation progress
- Celebrate improvements
- Allocate resources for culture-building activities
- Model generative behaviors yourself

**Red flags requiring immediate attention:**
- Scores declining over time
- Large gaps between teams
- Scores below 2.0 on any individual question
- Fear of completing the assessment honestly

---

## 🔄 Connection to Technical Practices

Remember: **Culture and practices are bidirectional.**

### Practices That Improve Culture

Research shows these technical practices measurably improve culture scores:

#### Continuous Delivery Practices
- **Version control:** Increases transparency
- **Automated testing:** Builds confidence and reduces blame
- **Deployment automation:** Shares responsibility
- **Continuous integration:** Encourages collaboration

#### Lean Management Practices
- **Limiting WIP:** Makes problems visible without blame
- **Visual management:** Increases information sharing
- **Lightweight change approval:** Empowers teams

#### Architectural Practices
- **Loosely coupled architecture:** Enables team autonomy
- **Empowered teams:** Increases risk-taking and innovation

**Key insight:** You don't need to fix culture before improving practices. Implementing better technical practices will improve your culture scores over time.
