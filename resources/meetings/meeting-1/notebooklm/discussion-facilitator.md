## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Assume listener is facilitating Meeting 1 book club discussion (25 minutes core discussion time). Create 10-15min facilitator guide: (1) Opening moves - ground discussion in team's current metrics (not DORA), make psychological safety explicit, avoid "teaching mode", (2) Part 1: DORA Metrics (10 min, 3 questions) - ask "Which metric hardest to improve?" not "What are the metrics?", use 46x/440x stats to challenge assumptions, watch for dismissal ("we're different"), redirect to "what would it take to prove this here?", (3) Part 2: Speed+Stability Myth (10 min, 3 questions) - ask for concrete deployment examples, expect "we need to slow down for quality" pushback, counter with research showing opposite, probe with "when did slowing down make it worse?", (4) Part 3: Culture Types (5 min, 2 questions) - quickly identify current culture type, focus on "can culture change through practice?" not definitions, end with one concrete behavior to try, (5) Facilitation techniques - handle silence with think-pair-share, handle dominators with "let's hear from someone else", handle disagreement with "what evidence would convince you?", keep time aggressively (set timer), capture commitments in writing. Key stat emphasis: 46x deploy frequency, 440x faster lead time, 170x faster recovery. Discuss: How to surface real challenges not generic complaints? How to end with actionable commitments not just interesting conversation?

### Extended Context (For Reference - Do Not Copy to NotebookLM)

**MEETING 1 CORE QUESTION:**
"How do we currently perceive and measure performance, and what would it take to shift our focus from local outputs to the global outcomes of speed and stability that matter?"

**25-MINUTE DISCUSSION STRUCTURE:**

**Part 1: Understanding DORA Metrics (10 min)**
- Question 1: What metrics does your organization currently use?
- Question 3: If you could only track one metric, which DORA metric would you choose and why?
- Question 17: Which DORA metric would be easiest to improve? Which would be hardest?

KEY FACILITATION MOVE: Don't let them spend 10 minutes defining DORA metrics. Assume knowledge from readings. Focus on "Which one first?" and "What's blocking improvement?"

**Part 2: Speed vs. Stability Myth (10 min)**
- Question 13: Before reading, did you believe speed and stability trade off?
- Question 14: How does the research (46x, 440x, 170x) challenge assumptions in your organization?
- Question 16: Can you think of a time when slowing down deployment actually made things worse?

KEY FACILITATION MOVE: Expect resistance. "Our industry is different." "Those are tech companies." Counter: "What evidence would convince you this applies here?" Focus on their specific examples, not abstract debate.

**Part 3: Culture & Change (5 min)**
- Question 9: Using Westrum's model, what culture type describes your organization?
- Question 21: Do you believe culture can be changed through implementing technical practices?

KEY FACILITATION MOVE: Don't let this become philosophical. Get quick culture type assessment, then focus on "Can we change it?" End with one behavior to experiment with.

**COMMON RESISTANCE PATTERNS:**

1. **"We're different"** → Ask: "What specifically is different? What would it take to test if DORA metrics apply?"
2. **Silence/Low participation** → Use think-pair-share: "Take 2 minutes to write your thoughts, then share with person next to you"
3. **One person dominating** → "Great point. Let's hear from someone we haven't heard from yet."
4. **Becomes complaint session** → Redirect: "What's ONE small thing we could change?"
5. **Disagreement about applicability** → "What experiment could we run to find out?"

**STATISTICS TO EMPHASIZE:**
- High performers: 46x more frequent deployments
- High performers: 440x faster lead time
- High performers: 170x faster recovery time
- These are NOT tech-only companies
- Culture types predict performance

**TIME MANAGEMENT:**
- Set visible timer for each part
- At 8 minutes in 10-min section: "One more perspective, then we'll move on"
- NEVER skip the closing commitment questions
- If running behind: Combine Parts 2 and 3, keep Part 1

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Each participant commits to tracking ONE specific DORA metric before Meeting 2
- Team identifies their current culture type with concrete examples
- At least one person challenges the speed/stability trade-off assumption in their context

## Troubleshooting Common Facilitation Challenges

**Challenge: "These numbers seem unrealistic"**
→ Response: "What would it take to verify if they apply in our context? Could we measure our current baseline?"

**Challenge: Participants haven't read chapters**
→ Response: Use first 2 minutes of each part to summarize key concept, then proceed with discussion questions

**Challenge: Discussion goes philosophical instead of practical**
→ Response: "Interesting point. How would that look in our team specifically? Can you give a concrete example?"

**Challenge: Running out of time**
→ Response: Cut Part 3 (culture) short, but NEVER skip the closing commitment questions in the Action Items section

**Challenge: Team becomes defensive about current practices**
→ Response: "We're not here to judge current state, we're here to learn what's possible. What small experiment could we try?"
