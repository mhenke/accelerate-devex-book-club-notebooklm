### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Assume viewer is visual learner for book club. Focus Ch 1-3 Accelerate. Create 10-15min visual video: (1) Four DORA metrics WITH charts (Lead Time, Deploy Freq, MTTR, Change Fail Rate) + elite vs low comparison (46x/440x/170x), (2) Speed+stability myth-busting WITH diagrams (inverse vs both increase), (3) Three culture types WITH color-coded columns (Pathological/red, Bureaucratic/yellow, Generative/green). Discuss: which metric first? Culture type? Practice to shift?
```

### Extended Context (For Reference - Do Not Copy to NotebookLM)

**OVERALL FRAMING QUESTION:**
"How can we build a virtuous cycle where improving our technical systems enhances our team culture, and where an improved culture, in turn, accelerates our ability to deliver value?"

**MEETING 1 CORE QUESTION:**
"How do we currently perceive and measure performance, and what would it take to shift from local outputs to global outcomes?"

**VIDEO STRUCTURE:**

INTRO (30 seconds):
- Title: "Accelerate Book Club - Meeting 1: Laying the Foundation"
- Chapters covered: 1-3
- Why these chapters matter for the book club journey

SEGMENT 1: THE FOUR DORA METRICS (3-4 minutes)
Visual: Show all 4 metrics as cards or quadrants

1. Lead Time for Changes
   - Visual: Pipeline from commit → production
   - Performance levels with benchmarks
   - Elite: < 1 hour

2. Deployment Frequency
   - Visual: Calendar showing deployment cadence
   - Elite: On demand (multiple per day)

3. Time to Restore Service
   - Visual: Incident timeline from detection → resolution
   - Elite: < 1 hour

4. Change Fail Rate
   - Visual: Success/failure ratio visualization
   - Elite/High: 0-15%

KEY VISUAL: Comparison table showing elite vs. low performers
- 46x more deployments
- 440x faster lead time
- 170x faster recovery

SEGMENT 2: SPEED + STABILITY MYTH-BUSTING (2-3 minutes)
Visual: Two diagrams side by side

MYTH diagram: Speed ↔ Stability (inverse relationship, see-saw)
REALITY diagram: Speed ↑ Stability ↑ (both increase together)

Show scatter plot: High performers cluster in top-right (high speed, high stability)

On-screen text: "High performers achieve BOTH through automation and technical practices"

SEGMENT 3: WESTRUM'S THREE CULTURE TYPES (3-4 minutes)
Visual: Three columns with icons/colors

PATHOLOGICAL (Red):
- Power-oriented
- Low cooperation
- Messengers shot
- Blame culture
- Example behaviors on screen

BUREAUCRATIC (Yellow):
- Rule-oriented
- Modest cooperation
- Messengers neglected
- Process culture
- Example behaviors on screen

GENERATIVE (Green):
- Performance-oriented
- High cooperation
- Messengers trained
- Learning culture
- Example behaviors on screen

KEY VISUAL: Arrow showing progression from Pathological → Bureaucratic → Generative
On-screen text: "Culture can be changed through implementing specific practices"

SEGMENT 4: HOW THEY CONNECT (2 minutes)
Visual: Diagram showing virtuous cycle

Technical Practices → Improved Metrics → Better Culture → More Improvement

On-screen text:
- "Start with practices"
- "Measure with DORA metrics"
- "Culture follows"

SEGMENT 5: CALL TO ACTION (1 minute)
On-screen questions for book club discussion:
1. Which DORA metric would you measure first?
2. Which culture type describes your org?
3. What one practice could shift your culture?

Resources shown:
- Meeting 1 outline
- Attendee guide
- DORA metrics template
- QR code or short link to NotebookLM notebook
- 60-90 second teaser clip for live demo

**VISUAL STYLE PREFERENCES:**
- Clean, professional diagrams
- Use color coding consistently (Red/Yellow/Green for culture types)
- Show data visualizations (charts, graphs, comparisons)
- Include on-screen text for key stats and quotes
- Use icons and illustrations to break up talking heads
- Show real-world examples where possible

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
Visual learners, teams watching together in a meeting, people who prefer video to audio, facilitators who want to show content during the meeting.

**LENGTH GUIDANCE:**
Aim for 10-15 minutes. Balance narration with visual content. Ensure key concepts are visible on screen, not just spoken. Export an additional 60-90 second teaser for the spotlight.

**ACCESSIBILITY:**
- Include captions/subtitles for all narration
- Use high contrast for text readability
- Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning
