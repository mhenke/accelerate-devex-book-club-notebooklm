## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Assume listener needs essentials for book club. Focus on Ch 1-3 Accelerate. Create 5-10min brief: (1) Four DORA metrics (Lead Time, Deploy Freq, MTTR, Change Fail Rate) - KEY: high performers 46x/440x, (2) Speed+stability NOT trade-off - achievable together, (3) Three culture types (Pathological/blame, Bureaucratic/rules, Generative/learning). Discuss: which metric first? Speed/stability trade off in your context? SKIP: methodology, details, examples.
```

### Extended Context (For Reference - Do Not Copy to NotebookLM)

**MEETING 1 CORE QUESTION:**
"How do we currently perceive and measure performance, and what would it take to shift our focus from local outputs to the global outcomes of speed and stability that matter?"

**ESSENTIAL TAKEAWAYS ONLY:**

1. THE FOUR DORA METRICS
   - Lead Time: Commit to production
   - Deployment Frequency: How often we deploy
   - Time to Restore: How fast we recover
   - Change Fail Rate: % of deployments that fail

   ONE KEY STAT: High performers deploy 46x more frequently with 440x faster lead time

2. SPEED + STABILITY ARE NOT A TRADE-OFF
   - High performers achieve BOTH simultaneously
   - This debunks the most common myth in software delivery

3. THREE CULTURE TYPES (30 seconds max)
   - Pathological: Blame and fear
   - Bureaucratic: Rules and process
   - Generative: Learning and performance

   Culture can be changed through practice

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
Busy professionals who need the absolute essentials before a book club meeting.

**LENGTH REQUIREMENT:**
Keep this EXTREMELY concise - 5-10 minutes maximum. Focus only on what listeners absolutely must know. No deep dives, no examples unless they're essential for understanding.

**CALL TO ACTION:**
Prompt listeners to think about:
- Which DORA metric would they measure first?
- Do they believe speed and stability trade off in their context?
