# Meeting 1: Foundation Presentation

Chapters 1-3 Overview

- Chapter 1: Accelerate - Software delivery capability drives organizational success
- Chapter 2: Measuring Performance - DORA metrics replace flawed traditional metrics
- Chapter 3: Measuring & Changing Culture - Culture can be measured and intentionally improved
- Evidence-based approach: 23,000+ survey responses, 2,000+ organizations over 4 years
- High performers achieve both speed AND stability simultaneously - no trade-offs required

Meeting 1 Key Question

**"How do we currently perceive and measure performance, and what would it take to shift our focus from local outputs (like utilization or story points) to the global outcomes of speed and stability that the research proves matter?"**

This question challenges teams to examine whether they're measuring what actually drives organizational success.

---

The Problem: False Choice Between Speed and Stability

- Most teams believe they must choose between fast delivery OR stable systems
- Fast delivery is seen as high risk, stable systems are seen as slow pace
- **The truth:** High performers achieve BOTH speed AND stability simultaneously
- No trade-offs required - practices that make you faster also make you more stable

---

Addressing Deployment Pain

- Deployment anxiety is a **signal of process problems**, not personal failure
- That knot in your stomach before deployment reveals systemic inefficiencies
- Root causes: Complex manual deployment processes, poor architecture, lack of automation
- Cultural signal: Fear indicates pathological or bureaucratic culture
- Your organization is sending you a message through deployment pain

---

The DORA Metrics Framework

- Lead Time: How long from commit to production deployment
- Deployment Frequency: How often you deploy to production
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): How fast you recover from incidents
- Change Failure Rate: What percentage of changes fail in production
- High performers excel in ALL FOUR metrics, not just some

---

Research Impact: High Performers Achieve

- 46x more frequent deployments than low performers
- 440x faster lead time from commit to deploy
- 170x faster recovery from incidents
- 5x lower change failure rate
- 2x more likely to exceed organizational goals

Westrum's Organizational Culture Types

**🚨 Pathological (Power-Oriented)**
- Low cooperation across groups
- Messengers "shot" for bringing bad news
- Responsibilities shirked when failure occurs
- Information hoarded or withheld for political reasons

**📋 Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)**
- Modest cooperation between departments
- Messengers neglected - not welcomed but not punished
- Responsibility compartmentalized by rules and departments
- Information flows through official channels

**🚀 Generative (Performance-Oriented)**
- High cooperation across the organization
- Messengers trained and developed
- Risks and responsibilities shared
- Information sought actively and shared freely

**Key Insight:** Generative culture strongly predicts software delivery and organizational performance

---

The Virtuous Cycle

- Technical practices create better interactions between teams
- Better interactions create generative culture patterns
- Generative culture enables high-performance technical practices
- Culture isn't fixed - it's an outcome, not a precondition for transformation
- You change culture by changing practices, not by changing minds first

---

Discussion Questions

- What anxiety levels exist in your deployment experience? What does this reveal?
- Where does your organization fall on the false "speed vs stability" spectrum?
- What's one technical practice we could adopt to shift toward generative culture?
- Using Westrum's model, what behaviors indicate your organization's culture type?

---

Action Items for Next Meeting

- Begin informal tracking of one DORA metric for your team
- Identify your biggest deployment pain point and document it
- Observe examples of pathological, bureaucratic, or generative culture behaviors
- Record anxiety level (1-10) before your next deployment and why
- Read Chapters 4-6 (Technical Practices, Architecture, Integrating Infosec)
- Preview question for Meeting 2: Which architectural or security practices create the most friction for our teams?
