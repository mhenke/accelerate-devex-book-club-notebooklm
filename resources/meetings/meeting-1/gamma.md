# Meeting 1: Foundation Presentation

Chapters 1-3 Overview

- Chapter 1: Accelerate - Software delivery capability drives organizational success
- Chapter 2: Measuring Performance - DORA metrics replace flawed traditional metrics
- Chapter 3: Measuring & Changing Culture - Culture can be measured and intentionally improved
- Evidence-based approach: 23,000+ survey responses identifying 24 key capabilities
- High performers achieve both speed AND stability simultaneously

---

The Problem: False Choice

- Most teams believe they must choose between fast delivery OR stable systems
- Fast delivery is seen as high risk, stable systems are seen as slow pace
- Deployment anxiety is a signal of deeper systemic problems in your organization
- That knot in your stomach before deployment isn't personal weakness
- Your organization is sending you a message through deployment pain

---

The DORA Metrics Framework

- Lead Time: How long from commit to production deployment
- Deployment Frequency: How often you deploy to production
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): How fast you recover from incidents
- Change Failure Rate: What percentage of changes fail in production
- High performers excel in ALL FOUR metrics, not just some

---

Research Impact: High Performers Achieve

- 46x more frequent deployments than low performers
- 440x faster lead time from commit to deploy
- 170x faster recovery from incidents
- 5x lower change failure rate
- 2x more likely to exceed organizational goals

---

Westrum Culture Types

- Pathological: Power-oriented, fear-driven, information hoarding
- Bureaucratic: Rule-oriented, departmental silos, narrow responsibilities
- Generative: Performance-oriented, high cooperation, shared risks
- Generative culture strongly predicts software delivery and organizational performance
- Key insight: "You can act your way to a better culture" through technical practices

---

The Virtuous Cycle

- Technical practices create better interactions between teams
- Better interactions create generative culture patterns
- Generative culture enables high-performance technical practices
- Culture isn't fixed - it's an outcome, not a precondition for transformation
- You change culture by changing practices, not by changing minds first

---

Discussion Questions

- What anxiety levels exist in your deployment experience? What does this reveal?
- Where does your organization fall on the false "speed vs stability" spectrum?
- What's one technical practice we could adopt to shift toward generative culture?
- Using Westrum's model, what behaviors indicate your organization's culture type?

---

Action Items for Next Meeting

- Record lead time for most recent production deploy
- Count deployments in the last 14 days
- Write a one-line deployment pain summary
- Read Chapters 4-6 (Technical Practices, Architecture, Security)
- Review the Culture Before Metrics handout
