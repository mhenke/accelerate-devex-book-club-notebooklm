## Success Criteria for Meeting 1

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue: Participants haven't read chapters**
**Solution:** Do 2-minute summary of each chapter, continue with discussion using handout

**Issue: Discussion becomes complaint session**
**Solution:** Redirect to: "What's one small thing we could change?" Use action-oriented questions

**Issue: One person dominating**
**Solution:** "Let's hear from someone we haven't heard from yet." Use round-robin format

**Issue: Silence/low participation**
**Solution:** Use think-pair-share. "Take 2 minutes to write your thoughts, then share with person next to you"

**Issue: Disagreement about metrics applicability**
**Solution:** Acknowledge different contexts, focus on learning what works where, not proving who's right
