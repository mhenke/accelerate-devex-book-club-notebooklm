# Meeting 1: Laying the Foundation – The Myth and the Measurement

**Week 1 | Duration:** 1 Hour

## Pre-Reading Assignment

**Chapters:** 1-3 (Accelerate, Measuring Performance, Measuring and Changing Culture)

- Chapter 1: Accelerate - Why software delivery matters
- Chapter 2: Measuring Performance - The four DORA metrics
- Chapter 3: Measuring and Changing Culture - Westrum's organizational culture typology

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Introduction to "Accelerate"

- **Central Argument:** High software delivery performance drives organizational success (profitability, productivity, market share)
- **Evidence-Based Approach:** 23,000+ survey responses from 2,000+ organizations over 4 years
- **Digital Transformation Reality:** Software delivery capability provides competitive advantage across all industries

### 2. The Four DORA Metrics - "Powerful New Vocabulary"

- **Delivery Lead Time:** Time from code commit to production (high performers: <1 hour)
- **Deployment Frequency:** How often code gets deployed (high performers: multiple times per day)
- **Mean Time to Restore Service:** Recovery time after incidents (high performers: <1 hour)
- **Change Fail Rate:** Percentage of deployments causing failures (high performers: 0-15%)

### 3. Debunking the Speed vs. Stability Myth

- **Key Insight:** High performers achieve BOTH speed AND stability simultaneously
- **46x more frequent deployments + 440x faster lead time + 170x faster recovery**
- **No Trade-offs:** Practices that make you faster also make you more stable

### 4. Addressing "Deployment Pain"

- **Recognition:** Anxiety before deployments signals process inefficiencies, not personal failing
- **Root Causes:** Complex, manual deployment processes and poor architecture
- **Cultural Signal:** Fear indicates pathological or bureaucratic culture

### 5. Westrum's Organizational Culture Types

Understanding how organizational culture affects information flow and performance:

#### 🚨 Pathological (Power-Oriented)
- Low cooperation across groups
- Messengers "shot" for bringing bad news  
- Responsibilities shirked when failure occurs
- Information hoarded or withheld for political reasons

#### 📋 Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)
- Modest cooperation between departments
- Messengers neglected - not necessarily welcomed but not punished
- Responsibility compartmentalized by rules and departments
- Information flows through official channels

#### 🚀 Generative (Performance-Oriented)  
- High cooperation across the organization
- Messengers trained and developed
- Risks and responsibilities shared
- Information sought actively and shared freely

**Key Insight**: Culture can be measured and changed through behavioral practices. Implementing technical practices measurably improves culture scores.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Current State Assessment:** How would you rate your team on each DORA metric?
2. **Speed vs. Stability Myths:** What examples have you seen of assumed trade-offs in your organization?
3. **Deployment Pain Points:** Describe your team's current deployment experience and anxiety levels
4. **Culture Indicators:** Using Westrum's model, what culture type best describes your organization?

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- [ ] Begin informal tracking of one DORA metric for your team
- [ ] Identify your biggest deployment pain point
- [ ] Observe examples of pathological, bureaucratic, or generative culture behaviors
