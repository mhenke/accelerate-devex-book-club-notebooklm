# Meeting 1 Leader Cheatsheet

**Laying the Foundation – The Myth and the Measurement**

## Quick Reference (1 Page)

### Meeting Timing (60 Minutes)

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **0-5 min** | Welcome & Check-in | Icebreaker: "Share one deployment anxiety story" |
| **5-15 min** | DORA Metrics Overview | Focus on "what" not "how to measure" |
| **15-30 min** | Speed + Stability Discussion | Use [Key Question](../../key-questions.md#meeting-1) |
| **30-40 min** | Westrum Culture Types | Have participants self-assess using examples |
| **40-45 min** | AI Tool Spotlight | Demo NotebookLM summary to reinforce key concepts |
| **45-55 min** | Action Items & Commitments | Each person commits to one metric to track |
| **55-60 min** | Preview Meeting 2 | Brief overview of CD practices |

### Top 3 Key Concepts

1. **DORA Metrics Provide Common Language**
   - Lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore, change fail rate
   - **Not** lines of code, velocity, or utilization
   - Enable data-driven conversations about performance

2. **Speed + Stability Go Together (Not Trade-Off)**
   - High performers: 46x, 440x, 170x better
   - Quality practices (automation, testing) enable both
   - Challenge assumption that "going faster means more bugs"

3. **Culture Can Be Changed Through Practice**
   - Pathological → Bureaucratic → Generative progression possible
   - "Act your way to better culture" through implementing practices
   - Culture is outcome, not prerequisite

### Common Misconceptions to Address

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Our context is different, metrics don't apply" | Research covered 2,000+ orgs across industries |
| "We must choose speed OR stability" | High performers achieve both simultaneously |
| "Culture change requires changing people" | Culture changes through changing practices |
| "DORA metrics will be used against developers" | Metrics are for team improvement, not individual assessment |

### Icebreaker / Opening Question

**"Think of your last production deployment. On a scale of 1-10, how anxious were you? Why?"**

This immediately surfaces deployment pain and makes the research personal.

### If Discussion Stalls - Backup Questions

1. **On DORA Metrics:**
   - "Which of the four metrics do you think would be easiest/hardest to improve in your organization?"
   - "What metrics does your organization currently use? How do they compare to DORA metrics?"

2. **On Speed vs. Stability:**
   - "Can you think of a time when slowing down actually made things worse, not better?"
   - "What quality practices do we already have that support both speed and stability?"

3. **On Culture:**
   - "Give an example of how information flows (or doesn't flow) in your organization."
   - "What happens when someone brings bad news to leadership?"

### Assessments to Use This Meeting

- **[DORA Metrics Template](../../assessments/dora-metrics-template.md)** - Distribute for baseline tracking
- **[Culture Assessment Worksheet](../../assessments/culture-assessment-worksheet.md)** - Help participants identify culture type
- **[24 Capabilities Assessment](../../assessments/24-capabilities-assessment.md)** - Optional: Establish complete baseline

### Time-Saving Tips

✅ **Do:**
- Use [Key Question](../../key-questions.md#meeting-1) to focus discussion
- Reference specific page numbers/quotes from book
- Encourage personal examples over abstract discussion
- Keep DORA metrics explanation simple (detailed measurement in Meeting 2)

⚠️ **Don't:**
- Get bogged down in "how to measure" details (save for later)
- Let discussion become complaint session about culture
- Try to solve all organizational problems in one meeting
- Skip action items due to time - these are critical

### Key Quotes to Reference

> "The key to successful change is to focus on building capabilities." (Chapter 1)

> "We found that there is no trade-off between improving performance and achieving higher levels of stability and quality." (Chapter 2)

> "You can influence your culture by implementing DevOps practices." (Chapter 3)

### Materials Needed

- ✅ Copies of [DORA Metrics Template](../../assessments/dora-metrics-template.md)
- ✅ [Discussion Guide](discussion-guide.md) questions ready
- ✅ Whiteboard/flipchart for capturing examples
- ✅ [Meeting Notes Template](../../templates/meeting-notes-template.md)

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Establish Psychological Safety**
   - Emphasize: deployment pain is system problem, not personal failure
   - Model vulnerability by sharing your own struggles
   - Use [Discussion Practices](../../activities/discussion-practices.md)

2. **Ground in Evidence**
   - Reference research constantly: "23,000+ surveys over 4 years"
   - Distinguish correlation vs. causation in findings
   - Cite specific statistics: 46x, 440x, 170x

3. **Make It Personal**
   - Connect metrics to daily developer experience
   - Use concrete examples from participants' work
   - Avoid abstract theoretical discussions

4. **Action-Oriented Close**
   - Every participant commits to tracking one metric
   - Schedule follow-up for action items
   - Clear expectations for Meeting 2

### Pivoting Strategies

**If group is skeptical about metrics:**
→ Acknowledge concerns, emphasize metrics are for team improvement, not individual evaluation

**If group wants to deep-dive measurement:**
→ Note interest, schedule separate session, keep meeting on track

**If discussion becomes too negative:**
→ Redirect to: "What's one small thing we could change?"

**If running behind:**
→ Shorten culture discussion, ensure DORA metrics and action items covered

### Post-Meeting Follow-Up

- ✅ Send [Meeting Notes](../../templates/meeting-notes-template.md) within 24 hours
- ✅ Share [Meeting 2 resources](../meeting-2/) for preparation
- ✅ Check in on action items before next meeting
- ✅ Generate and share [NotebookLM podcasts](../../notebooklm-prompts/) if not done pre-meeting
