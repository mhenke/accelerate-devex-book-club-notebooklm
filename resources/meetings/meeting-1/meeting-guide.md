# Meeting 1: Laying the Foundation ‚Äì The Myth and the Measurement

**Week 1 | Duration:** 1 Hour

## Pre-Reading Assignment

**Chapters:** 1-3 (Accelerate, Measuring Performance, Measuring and Changing Culture)

- Chapter 1: Accelerate - Why software delivery matters
- Chapter 2: Measuring Performance - The four DORA metrics
- Chapter 3: Measuring and Changing Culture - Westrum's organizational culture typology

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Introduction to "Accelerate"

- **Central Argument:** High software delivery performance drives organizational success
- **Evidence-Based Approach:** Understanding the rigorous research behind the book's findings
- **Digital Transformation Reality:** How software delivery capability provides competitive advantage

### 2. Addressing "Deployment Pain"

- **Recognition:** Nervousness before deployments as a signal of process inefficiencies, not personal failing
- **Root Causes:** Gaps between development and IT operations, differing workflows and terminologies
- **Impact Assessment:** How deployment anxiety affects team wellbeing and productivity

### 3. Debunking the Speed vs. Stability Myth

- **Key Insight:** High-performing organizations achieve both speed AND stability
- **Evidence:** Research showing no trade-offs between these metrics
- **Mindset Shift:** Understanding that practices making you faster also make you more stable

### 4. The Four DORA Metrics

#### üìà Delivery Lead Time

Time from code commit to production deployment

#### üöÄ Deployment Frequency

How often code gets deployed to production

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Time to Restore Service

How quickly service is restored after incidents

#### ‚ùå Change Fail Rate

Percentage of deployments causing failures in production

### 4. Westrum's Organizational Culture Types

Understanding how organizational culture affects information flow and performance:

#### üö® Pathological (Power-Oriented)
- Low cooperation across groups
- Messengers "shot" for bringing bad news  
- Responsibilities shirked when failure occurs
- Information hoarded or withheld for political reasons

#### üìã Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)
- Modest cooperation between departments
- Messengers neglected - not necessarily welcomed but not punished
- Responsibility compartmentalized by rules and departments
- Information flows through official channels

#### üöÄ Generative (Performance-Oriented)  
- High cooperation across the organization
- Messengers trained and developed
- Risks and responsibilities shared
- Information sought actively and shared freely

**Key Insight**: Culture can be measured and changed through behavioral practices. Implementing technical practices measurably improves culture scores.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Current State Assessment:** How would you rate your team on each DORA metric?
2. **Speed vs. Stability Myths:** What examples have you seen of assumed trade-offs in your organization?
3. **Deployment Pain Points:** Describe your team's current deployment experience and anxiety levels
4. **Culture Indicators:** Using Westrum's model, what culture type best describes your organization?

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- [ ] Begin informal tracking of one DORA metric for your team
- [ ] Identify your biggest deployment pain point
- [ ] Observe examples of pathological, bureaucratic, or generative culture behaviors
