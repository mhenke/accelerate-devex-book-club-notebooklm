### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Assume listener is manager/practitioner. Focus Ch 7-10 Accelerate. Create 15-20min: (1) Five Lean Practices - WIP limits expose systemic issues (1-2 items/person), visual mgmt shows flow/blockers, proactive monitoring (AWS: 78% proactive detection), lightweight approval (CABs negatively correlated with performance AND zero stability benefit - use peer review instead), small batches (risk grows quadratically with size), (2) Product dev - customer feedback loops, MVPs for learning, team empowerment, (3) Deployment pain predicts burnout - 60% variance from toxic workplace (systemic problem), Microsoft Bing: 38%→75% satisfaction jump with CD, automation + culture change required, (4) Satisfaction four pillars - tools/automation, meaningful work, generative culture, learning. Creates virtuous cycle: satisfaction → performance → business success → reinvestment. Key: CABs harmful, batch risk exponential, burnout systemic not individual. Discuss: Current WIP? Using CABs? Pain score 1-10? Missing satisfaction factors? How shift to systemic solutions?

- ✅ Customer-centric product development with small batches
- ✅ Deployment pain as systemic burnout predictor
- ✅ Employee satisfaction four pillars
- ✅ Connection between sustainability and performance (virtuous cycle)
