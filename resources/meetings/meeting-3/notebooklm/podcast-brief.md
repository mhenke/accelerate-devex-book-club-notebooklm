```
Assume listener needs essentials. Focus Ch 7-10 Accelerate. Create 5-10min: (1) Five Lean - WIP limits (1-2 items/person), visual mgmt, proactive monitoring (AWS: 78% proactive), lightweight approval (CABs negatively correlated with performance + NO stability gain), small batches (risk grows quadratically), (2) Deployment pain → burnout - 60% variance from toxic workplace (systemic not individual), Microsoft Bing: 38%→75% satisfaction with CD, (3) Satisfaction pillars - tools, meaningful work, culture, learning. Key: CABs harmful, batch risk nonlinear, burnout systemic. Discuss: WIP count? Still using CABs? Pain score? Missing satisfaction factors?
