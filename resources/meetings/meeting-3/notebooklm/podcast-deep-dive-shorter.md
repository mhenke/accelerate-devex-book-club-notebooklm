Assume listener needs quick overview. Focus Ch 7-10 Accelerate. Create 10-15min: (1) Five Lean - WIP limits (1-2 items), visual boards, proactive monitoring, lightweight approval (CABs negatively correlated + zero stability), small batches (quadratic risk), (2) Product - customer feedback, MVPs, (3) Pain → burnout - 60% variance from toxic workplace, Microsoft Bing: 38%→75% with CD, (4) Satisfaction pillars - tools, meaning, culture, learning. Key: CABs harmful, batch risk nonlinear, burnout systemic. Discuss: WIP? Pain? Satisfaction?
