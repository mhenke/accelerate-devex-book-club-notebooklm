Assume listener needs quick overview. Focus Ch 7-10 Accelerate. Create 10-15min: (1) Five Lean (WIP, visual, monitoring, approval, batches), (2) Product (customer-centric, MVP), (3) Deployment pain → burnout, automation helps, (4) Satisfaction = tools + meaning + culture. Discuss: WIP? Pain? Satisfaction?
