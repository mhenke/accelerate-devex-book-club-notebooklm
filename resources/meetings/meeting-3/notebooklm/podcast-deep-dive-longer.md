## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
Assume listener wants comprehensive implementation guide. Focus Ch 7-10 Accelerate. Create 20-25min: (1) Five Lean Practices - WIP limits (1-2 items/person) expose systemic not individual failures, visual mgmt (kanban showing blockers), proactive monitoring (AWS: 78% proactive), lightweight approval (CABs negatively correlated with ALL outcomes + zero stability - use peer review), small batches (risk quadratic - doubling size more than doubles risk), (2) Product dev - customer feedback integration, MVPs/A/B testing for validated learning, team empowerment reduces handoffs, small increments enable pivoting, (3) Deployment pain mechanics - manual deploys create anxiety/off-hours work, 60% burnout variance from toxic workplace (systemic problem needs org solutions not resilience training), Microsoft Bing: 38%→75% satisfaction with CD, six burnout factors (overload, control, rewards, community, fairness, values), (4) Satisfaction research - four pillars (tools, meaningful work, culture, learning), creates virtuous cycle, diversity matters, time allocation: 49% new work vs 38%, 22% less unplanned. Connect: lean → less pain → satisfaction → performance → success → reinvestment. Discuss: WIP per person now? Pain pipeline sources? Satisfaction factors present/absent? Single practice for biggest impact?
