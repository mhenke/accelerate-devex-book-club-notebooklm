## Core Framing Question

> **See [Key Questions - Meeting 3](../../../key-questions.md#meeting-3)**

**"Given the research showing CABs are negatively correlated with performance AND show zero stability improvement, and that toxic workplace behavior predicts 60% of burnout variance, how could we apply Lean principles like limiting WIP and visualizing work to reduce 'deployment pain' (where risk grows near-quadratically with batch size) and address burnout through systemic solutions rather than individual interventions?"**

This question directly challenges organizational sacred cows (Change Advisory Boards) with research findings, emphasizes the systemic nature of burnout (60% variance), and highlights the counterintuitive nonlinear risk of large batches. It links Lean management practices (Ch. 7) to sustainability outcomes (Ch. 9) and incorporates drivers of employee satisfaction (Ch. 10), framed as systemic organizational changes rather than individual wellness programs.

## Quick Start: Recommended Meeting Flow

**Full Meeting: 60 minutes (25 min core discussion + 35 min other activities) | Questions Used: 6-8**

*Note: The agenda allocates 25 minutes for core discussion. Opening/wrap-up happen in other agenda sections (welcome, action items).*

### Part 1: Lean Management Practices (10 min)
- **Question 1:** Does your team have explicit WIP limits? If yes, are they enforced? If no, how do you decide how much work to take on?
- **Question 7:** What would happen if your team tried limiting WIP to 1-2 items per person? What resistance would you encounter?
- **Question 14:** Given the research showing CABs are negatively correlated with performance and don't improve stability, what approval processes could replace your CAB?

### Part 2: Product Development & Small Batches (10 min)
- **Question 17:** How large are your typical deployments (number of features/changes)? What prevents smaller releases?
- **Question 19:** The research shows risk grows "near quadratically" with batch size. Can you recall a deployment where size contributed to problems?
- **Question 22:** How long does customer feedback take to reach developers? What would "tightening the loop" look like?

### Part 3: Burnout & Sustainability (5 min)
- **Question 25:** What contributes most to stress or burnout on your team: on-call burden, deployment anxiety, unclear priorities, or something else?
- **Question 32:** Research shows toxic workplace behavior predicts 60% of burnout variance. What systemic workplace changes would reduce burnout more than individual resilience training?

## Question Bank: All Options

**Instructions:** Browse questions below and select 6-8 that fit your team's context for the **25-minute core discussion**. The [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-recommended-meeting-flow) above provides a recommended selection for a typical meeting.

### Section A: Understanding Current State

**On Work Management:**
1. Does your team have explicit WIP limits? If yes, are they enforced? If no, how do you decide how much work to take on?
2. How visible is your work? Can someone outside your team see what you're working on and what's blocking you?
3. What quality metrics does your team track? Are they displayed visibly where the team can see them?
4. Where are your biggest bottlenecks? How do you know?

**On Workload and Stress:**
5. How often do you feel overloaded with too much work in progress?
6. How many different projects or work items are you actively working on right now? How does that feel?
7. What would happen if your team tried limiting WIP to 1-2 items per person? What resistance would you encounter?
8. When was the last time you had slack time to work on improvements, learning, or experiments?

**On Change Approval:**
9. What is your organization's change approval process for production deployments?
10. How long does approval take? What value does the approval process provide?
11. Who has authority to approve changes? Do they have context to evaluate technical risk?
12. Have you ever seen an approval process catch a problem that automated testing didn't find?

**On Deployment and Sustainability:**
13. On a scale of 1-10, how much anxiety or "pain" do you feel before deployments? What specific factors cause that pain?
14. Given the research showing CABs are negatively correlated with performance and don't improve stability, what approval processes could replace your CAB?
15. What would make deployments less painful or stressful for your team?
16. When something goes wrong in production, do you feel supported or blamed?

### Section B: Exploring Concepts

**On Working in Small Batches:**
17. How large are your typical deployments (number of features/changes)? What prevents smaller releases?
18. What would it take to reduce your deployment batch size by half?
19. The research shows risk grows "near quadratically" with batch size. Can you recall a deployment where size contributed to problems?
20. How could working in smaller batches improve your team's ability to respond to customer feedback?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What's the smallest releasable change you could make?"
- "What prevents more frequent, smaller releases?"
- "How would small batches change your testing strategy?"

**On Customer Feedback:**
21. How do you currently gather customer feedback on features you've built?
22. How long does customer feedback take to reach developers? What would "tightening the loop" look like?
23. Can you recall a time when earlier customer feedback would have prevented wasted work?
24. How does your team balance building new features with incorporating customer feedback on existing features?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Who talks to customers on your team?"
- "What prevents direct developer-customer interaction?"
- "How could you validate assumptions before building?"

**On Burnout and Sustainability:**
25. What contributes most to stress or burnout on your team: on-call burden, deployment anxiety, unclear priorities, or something else?
26. Is burnout addressed through individual interventions (resilience training, wellness programs) or systemic solutions (process improvements, workload management)?
27. What happens when someone on your team shows signs of burnout? Do you address the person or the system?
28. How does "deployment pain" connect to burnout on your team?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What systemic changes would reduce stress?"
- "Who has authority to change the system?"
- "What small experiment could we try?"

**On Employee Satisfaction:**
29. If you surveyed your team on likelihood to recommend this as a great place to work (eNPS), what score would you get?
30. Which factor would most improve satisfaction: more autonomy, clearer vision, better tools, more learning opportunities, or stronger customer connection?
31. How much control do team members have over their work, tools, and practices?

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "What prevents greater autonomy?"
- "How clear is our team's vision and purpose?"
- "What learning opportunities exist?"

### Section C: Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Approval Bottleneck**
Your organization requires all production changes to be reviewed by a Change Advisory Board that meets twice per week. Last sprint, three deployments were delayed by an average of 4 days waiting for CAB approval. The research shows CABs are negatively correlated with performance and don't improve stability. How do you approach changing this process?

**Discussion points:**
- What data would convince leadership CABs don't add value?
- What lightweight alternatives (peer review, automated gates) could replace CAB?
- How to transition without appearing "reckless"?

**Scenario 2: The Burnout Crisis**
A valued team member just gave notice, citing burnout. In the exit interview, they mention: constant context switching between projects, frequent on-call pages, deployment anxiety, and feeling like their concerns about workload were dismissed. What would you change?

**Discussion points:**
- Which factors are individual vs. systemic?
- What systemic changes would address root causes?
- How to prevent this from happening to others?

**Scenario 3: The Batch Size Problem**
Your team deploys monthly releases containing 20-30 features. Last deployment caused a production outage, and it took 6 hours to identify which of the 25 changes caused the problem. Leadership is now proposing quarterly releases to "reduce risk." How do you respond using the book's research?

**Discussion points:**
- Why do larger batches increase rather than decrease risk?
- How to demonstrate small batches are safer?
- What would enable weekly or daily releases?

**Scenario 4: The "Faux Agile" Theater**
Your team has all the agile ceremonies: daily stand-ups, sprints, retrospectives. However, developers have little say in what they work on, estimates are treated as deadlines, and the "Product Owner" is a committee of stakeholders who provide conflicting requirements. How do you start a conversation about moving from "faux agile" to genuine agile practices?

**Discussion points:**
- How can we use retrospectives to address the process itself, not just the work?
- What small, concrete changes can the team make to increase their autonomy?
- How can we better educate stakeholders on agile principles?

### Section D: Team Self-Assessment

**Work-in-Progress:**
32. Research shows toxic workplace behavior predicts 60% of burnout variance. What systemic workplace changes would reduce burnout more than individual resilience training?
33. How many items is each team member actively working on?
   - 1-2 items (focused)
   - 3-4 items (moderate switching)
   - 5-6 items (high switching)
   - 7+ items (severe fragmentation)

34. What blocks visibility into your work?

**Batch Size:**
35. How many changes/features in a typical deployment?
   - 1-3 changes (small batches)
   - 4-10 changes (medium batches)
   - 11-20 changes (large batches)
   - 20+ changes (very large batches)

36. What prevents smaller batch sizes?

**Customer Feedback Loop:**
37. How long from feature completion to customer feedback?
   - Less than 1 week (tight loop)
   - 1-4 weeks (moderate loop)
   - 1-3 months (loose loop)
   - More than 3 months (very loose loop)

38. What would tighten this feedback loop?

**Deployment Pain:**
39. Rate deployment anxiety (1-10 scale):
   - 1-3: Confident, routine
   - 4-6: Some concern, manageable
   - 7-8: Significant anxiety
   - 9-10: High fear/dread

40. What specific factors cause deployment pain?

### Section E: Reflection and Commitment

**Personal Reflection:**
41. What surprised you most in chapters 7-10?
42. Which concept challenged your existing beliefs about management or sustainability?
43. How does your team's approach to WIP compare to Lean principles?
44. What's your biggest takeaway from Meeting 3?

**Team Commitment:**
45. What WIP limit will you propose or experiment with before Meeting 4?
46. How will you visualize work to make bottlenecks more apparent?
47. What is one systemic change you'll advocate for to reduce burnout or deployment pain?
48. What will you measure to assess whether changes improve sustainability?

## How to Customize Your Discussion

### For Facilitators

**Step 1: Choose Your Approach**
- **Option A:** Use the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-recommended-meeting-flow) above (8 pre-selected questions for 25 min)
- **Option B:** Build custom discussion by selecting 6-8 questions from the [Question Bank](#question-bank-all-options)

**Step 2: Selection Guidelines (for 25-minute core discussion)**
- **Start with current state:** Select 2-3 questions from Section A to ground discussion in team's experience (10 min)
- **Focus on 1 key concept:** Choose either WIP/Lean practices OR burnout/sustainability for depth (10 min)
- **Close with reflection:** 1-2 questions from Section E if time permits (5 min)
- **Skip scenarios:** Scenarios add 10 minutes and won't fit in 25-minute discussion slot

**Step 3: Facilitation Tips**
- **Use follow-up prompts** provided in each section to deepen superficial answers
- **Reference book statistics** (60% burnout variance, CABs negatively correlated, quadratic risk growth) when challenging assumptions
- **Capture commitments** in writing - these become Meeting 4 accountability check-ins
- **If running short on time:** Skip scenarios, keep reflection questions

### For Participants

- **Come prepared** with specific examples from your work (deployment stories, workload challenges, customer feedback experiences)
- **Be honest** about current state - psychological safety is essential for real discussion
