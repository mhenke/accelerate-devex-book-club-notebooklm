# Faux Agile for Leaders

As a leader, it's crucial to understand the difference between genuine agile practices and "faux agile" – the cargo cult ceremony without the substance. Your role is to foster an environment where agile can thrive, not just survive. This guide will help you spot the warning signs and take corrective action.

## Are You Enabling Faux Agile?

Ask yourself these questions:

*   **Are you treating estimates as deadlines?** If you're using velocity and story points to create a delivery schedule and holding teams accountable for hitting it, you're missing the point. Agile is about delivering value, not hitting arbitrary dates.
*   **Are you driving the "what" and the "how"?** Your role is to provide the "why" and the "what" (the strategic goals), but the team should own the "how" (the implementation details). If you're dictating tasks, you're not empowering your team.
*   **Are you rewarding output over outcomes?** Do you celebrate shipping features, or do you celebrate moving the needle on key business metrics? True agility is about achieving outcomes, not just producing a lot of code.
*   **Is failure a learning opportunity or a career-limiting move?** Agile requires psychological safety. If your team is afraid to fail, they'll never take the risks required to innovate.

## How to Be a Better Agile Leader

1.  **Focus on Outcomes, Not Output.**
    *   Define success by business metrics, not by the number of story points completed.
    *   Give your teams problems to solve, not a list of features to build.

2.  **Create Psychological Safety.**
    *   Decouple failure from blame. Treat mistakes as opportunities to learn and improve.
    *   Encourage experimentation and risk-taking.

3.  **Be a Servant Leader.**
    *   Your job is to remove impediments for your team, not to direct their work.
    *   Ask "How can I help?" and then listen.

4.  **Shield the Team from Bureaucracy.**
    *   Protect your team from external pressures and interruptions.
    *   Be the interface to the rest of the organization, so the team can focus on delivering value.

**The Bottom Line:** Agile is not a process you can install like a piece of software. It's a culture you have to build. As a leader, you are the primary architect of that culture.
