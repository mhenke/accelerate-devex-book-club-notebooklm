### Backup Questions

- "Where is work waiting? What's our largest queue?"
- "What's the last time deployment caused off-hours work? Why?"
- "Which satisfaction driver is weakest for the team right now?"

### Icebreaker / Opening Question

**"On a scale of 1-10, how sustainable does your current work pace feel? What's one thing that makes it better or worse?"**

This icebreaker immediately surfaces burnout risks and work-life balance issues—the core of Meeting 3's focus on sustainability. It's personal, low-stakes, and helps participants recognize that deployment pain and work sustainability are connected to system design, not personal failings.

**Alternative if group prefers concrete examples:** "Share one time in the past month when work felt 'in flow' vs. one time it felt chaotic. What was different?"

This alternative helps surface the concepts of WIP limits, batch size, and visual management through real experiences.

### Materials

- ✅ [Discussion Guide](discussion-guide.md)
- ✅ Prepare method for tracking action items (e.g., whiteboard, shared document)
- ✅ Whiteboard/markers
### Tips

✅ Keep the focus on small, high-leverage changes this week.

⚠️ Avoid turning this into a broad process redesign—capture ideas, timebox decisions.
