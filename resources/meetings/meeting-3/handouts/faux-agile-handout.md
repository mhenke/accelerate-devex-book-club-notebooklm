# The "Faux Agile" Playbook

Welcome to the world of "Faux Agile," where we talk the talk of agility but walk the walk of rigid, bureaucratic processes. Here’s how you can master the art of looking agile without actually changing anything important.

## Key Principles of Faux Agile

1.  **Sprints are just mini-waterfalls.**
    *   Spend the first week in planning meetings.
    *   Spend two weeks writing code without talking to anyone.
    *   Spend the last week in a frantic rush to test and integrate everything.
    *   Call it a "sprint."

2.  **Stand-ups are for status reporting to managers.**
    *   Each person must give a detailed account of everything they did yesterday and everything they will do today.
    *   Go around the room in a circle. No interruptions.
    *   The Scrum Master is there to enforce the rules and take notes for management.

3.  **The backlog is a black hole.**
    *   The Product Owner is the only one who can add or prioritize items.
    *   The development team has no say in what they work on.
    *   Estimates are treated as commitments, and any deviation is a sign of failure.

4.  **Retrospectives are for blaming people.**
    *   Find a scapegoat for why the sprint failed.
    *   Generate action items that no one will ever follow up on.
    *   Repeat the same mistakes in the next sprint.

5.  **Agile is a process, not a mindset.**
    *   Follow the ceremonies religiously.
    *   Don't worry about the underlying principles of collaboration, customer value, or continuous improvement.
    *   If anyone questions the process, tell them they are "not being a team player."

## How to Tell if You're Doing Faux Agile

*   You have a "hardening sprint" at the end of every release.
*   Your "user stories" are just tasks in disguise.
*   You need to get approval from three different committees to change the color of a button.
*   Your team is "agile," but the rest of the organization is not.
