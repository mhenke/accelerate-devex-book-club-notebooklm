# Meeting 3: Informational Handout

## Key Topics

This handout provides a summary of the key topics for our third book club meeting.

### Chapter 5: Architectural Capabilities

*   **Loosely Coupled Architecture:** Build systems with low coupling to allow teams to work and deploy independently.
*   **Monolith vs. Microservices:** Weigh the trade-offs between monolithic and microservices architectures.
*   **Testability:** Good architecture makes testing easier and more effective.

### Chapter 6: Continuous Delivery

*   **Deployment Pipeline:** Automate the software delivery process.
*   **Four Key Metrics:** Measure software delivery performance: lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, and change fail percentage.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Regularly integrate and test code changes.

### Chapter 7: Lean Management and Monitoring

*   **WIP Limits:** Limit Work in Progress to improve flow and reduce context switching.
*   **Visual Management:** Use tools like Kanban boards to track work and find bottlenecks.
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Find and fix issues before they impact users.
