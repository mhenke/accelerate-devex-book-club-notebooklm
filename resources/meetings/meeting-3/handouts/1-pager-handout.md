## The Essentials

### Lean Management (Chapter 7)

*   **Goal:** Improve flow and get faster feedback.
*   **Key Idea:** Limit Work in Progress (WIP). Stop starting, start finishing.
*   **See Your Work:** Use visual tools (like Kanban boards) to understand your workflow.
*   **Lightweight Approvals:** Peer review is better than external change boards.

### Product Development (Chapter 8)

*   **Goal:** Build the right thing, and build it right.
*   **Key Idea:** Work in small batches to reduce risk and get faster feedback.
*   **Customer Feedback:** Integrate customer feedback directly into the development process.
*   **Team Experimentation:** Give teams the autonomy to innovate.

### Making Work Sustainable (Chapter 9)

*   **Goal:** Avoid burnout and keep teams productive long-term.
*   **Key Idea:** "Deployment pain" is a sign of problems in your delivery process, not a personal failing.
*   **Address Burnout Systemically:** Don't just tell people to "be more resilient." Fix the system that is causing the burnout.

### Employee Satisfaction (Chapter 10)

*   **Goal:** Create a workplace where people can do their best work.
*   **Key Idea:** High-performing organizations have employees with high job satisfaction.
*   **Measure What Matters:** Use eNPS to gauge employee loyalty and satisfaction.
*   **Invest in Your People:** Autonomy, meaningful work, and good tools are key drivers of satisfaction.
