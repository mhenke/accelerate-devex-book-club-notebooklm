## The Essentials

### Architectural Capabilities (Chapter 5)

*   **Goal:** Build systems that can be changed and deployed quickly and safely.
*   **Key Idea:** Loosely coupled architecture. Teams can work on their own parts without breaking everything else.
*   **Big Question:** Can we deploy our service without coordinating with other teams?

### Continuous Delivery (Chapter 6)

*   **Goal:** Make deployments boring, not terrifying.
*   **Key Idea:** Automate the path to production with a deployment pipeline.
*   **The Magic Numbers (DORA Metrics):**
    *   **Lead Time:** How long from code commit to production? (Shorter is better)
    *   **Deployment Frequency:** How often do we deploy? (More often is better)
    *   **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR):** How long to fix a failure? (Shorter is better)
    *   **Change Fail %:** How often do our changes cause failures? (Lower is better)

### Lean Management & Monitoring (Chapter 7)

*   **Goal:** Improve the flow of work and get faster feedback.
*   **Key Idea:** Limit Work in Progress (WIP). Stop starting, start finishing.
*   **See Your Work:** Use visual tools (like Kanban boards) to understand your workflow.
*   **Look Ahead:** Proactive monitoring helps you find problems before your users do.
