3. Review [Discussion Guide](leadership/discussion-guide.md) and note personal examples
4. Complete Meeting 2 action items and prepare to share findings
5. Observe work-in-progress, batch size, and burnout indicators in your team

## Meeting Outcomes

By the end of Meeting 3, participants should:
- **Understand** lean management practices (WIP limits, visual management, monitoring)
- **Recognize** that batch size has near-quadratic relationship with deployment risk
- **Identify** burnout risk factors and understand systemic solutions
- **Understand** factors that drive job satisfaction and employee engagement
- **Plan** work visualization and WIP limit experiments to try before Meeting 4

## Key Concepts Covered

### Management Practices (Chapter 7)
- **WIP Limits:** Reduce context switching, focus teams, locate bottlenecks
- **Visual Management:** Dashboards and boards that drive process improvements
- **Change Approval:** CABs negatively correlated with performance, peer review superior
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Proactive notification before failures occur
- **AWS Example:** 78% of incidents detected proactively through automation

### Product Development (Chapter 8)
- **Customer Feedback:** Active, regular feedback incorporated into design
- **Value Stream Visibility:** Understanding flow from business to customers
- **Working in Small Batches:** Work completed in < 1 week reduces risk exponentially
- **Team Experimentation:** Autonomy to try new ideas and learn from failures
- **Critical Finding:** Near-quadratic growth of risk as batch size increases

### Making Work Sustainable (Chapter 9)
- **Deployment Pain:** Fear and anxiety indicate poor practices, not personal failure
- **Burnout Research:** Toxic workplace predicts 60% of burnout variance
- **Systemic Solutions:** Organizational interventions more effective than individual training
- **Manager Actions:** Foster respect, communicate purpose, invest in development, remove blockers
- **Key Insight:** "If it hurts, do it more often"frequent deployments force improvements

### Employee Satisfaction (Chapter 10)
- **Job Satisfaction Factors:** Control/autonomy, clear vision, experimentation, diversity, customer connection
- **eNPS Measurement:** Employee Net Promoter Score (good: 10-30, excellent: 30+)
- **Research Finding:** High performers 2x more likely to recommend organization
- **Correlation:** Satisfaction tied to customer feedback, tight feedback loops, autonomy

## Key Statistics

### Batch Size & Risk
- **Near-quadratic growth** of deployment risk as batch size increases
- Small batches enable faster feedback, lower costs, reduced errors, faster MTTR

### Burnout
- Toxic workplace behavior predicts **60%** of total burnout variance
- Employees with < 1 year or > 15 years tenure report **lowest burnout** (~30-31%)
- **Systemic solutions** far more effective than individual interventions

### Employee Satisfaction
- High-performer employees **2x more likely** to recommend organization
- eNPS benchmarks: **36** (< 3 years experience), **47** (construction industry)
- Satisfaction has **significant correlation** with customer feedback-driven development

### Continuous Delivery Impact
- Organizations with CD spend **49%** of time on new work vs. **38%** without CD
- High performers spend **22%** less time on unplanned work/rework
- High performers spend **29%** more time on new features

### Proactive Monitoring
- AWS Managed Services detects **78%** of performance-impacting incidents proactively
- 2014 DORA research: Proactive notification is **significant predictor** of performance

## Action Items for Next Meeting

Before Meeting 4 (Week 7), participants should:
- Implement work visualization (board, dashboard) and observe for one sprint/week
- Experiment with WIP limits (1-3 items per person) and document bottlenecks
- Measure typical batch size (features per deployment) and work to reduce
- Assess team burnout risk factors and identify one systemic improvement
- Gather customer feedback and document how it reaches developers

- Week 7
- Focus: Transformational leadership and making the transformation your own
