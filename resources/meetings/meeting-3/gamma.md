# Meeting 3: Management & Sustainability Presentation

Chapters 7-10 Overview

- Chapter 7: Management Practices - Lean management for software delivery
- Chapter 8: Product Development - Lean approach to the "fuzzy front end"
- Chapter 9: Making Work Sustainable - Deployment pain and burnout are symptoms
- Chapter 10: Employee Satisfaction - Satisfaction drives business outcomes
- Same practices that improve performance also improve work-life balance and reduce burnout

Meeting 3 Key Question

**"Given CABs are negatively correlated with performance AND show zero stability improvement, and toxic workplace predicts 60% of burnout variance, how could we apply Lean principles (limiting WIP, visualizing work) to reduce deployment pain (risk grows near-quadratically with batch size) and address burnout through systemic solutions?"**

This question connects CABs, lean management, deployment pain, and burnout—showing they're all symptoms of the same systemic problems.

Traditional vs Lean Management

- Traditional: Approval-heavy processes with command-and-control
- Lean: Enable and empower teams with lightweight approval
- Change Advisory Boards (CABs) negatively correlated with performance
- Formal external approval processes slow delivery without improving stability
- Peer review (pair programming, code reviews) achieves higher performance

---

Three Core Lean Management Practices

- **Limit Work In Progress (WIP):** Using limits to expose systemic problems and drive process improvement
- **Visualize Work:** Dashboards showing quality, productivity metrics, bottlenecks at a glance
- **Feedback from Production:** Application/infrastructure data used for daily business decisions
  - AWS detects 78% of incidents proactively through automation and monitoring
  - Proactive alerts enable action before customers are affected

---

Lean Product Development

- **Customer Feedback Integration:** Actively seeking and incorporating customer input into design
- **Value Stream Visibility:** Understanding work flow from business to customers
- **Team Experimentation:** Authority to create/change specifications without external approval
- **Work in Small Batches:** Features completed in less than one week
  - **Critical:** Risk grows near-quadratically with batch size
  - Benefits: Easier problem identification, simple rollback, shorter cycles, lower failures

Lean Management Impact

- 2x better software delivery performance
- 1.8x more generative culture
- 50% less burnout across teams
- 38% to 75% work-life satisfaction improvement (Microsoft Bing case)
- Lean practices create a virtuous cycle reducing stress and improving culture

---

Deployment Pain & Burnout Prevention

- **Deployment pain is the strongest predictor of burnout**
- Fear during releases indicates friction between dev and ops
- Manual, error-prone processes create sustained anxiety
- **Toxic workplace predicts 60% of burnout variance**
- **Six burnout risk factors:** Work overload, lack of control, insufficient rewards, community breakdown, absence of fairness, value conflicts
- Technical practices eliminate pain at its source, not just symptoms
- Microsoft Bing: Work-life satisfaction improved from 38% → 75% with CD practices

Employee Satisfaction: The Four Pillars

- Meaningful Work: Challenging work that makes a difference
- Learning & Growth: Opportunities to develop skills and advance
- Team Support: Psychological safety and collaboration
- Right Tools: Resources needed to do the job effectively
- High performers are 2.2x more likely to recommend their organization

Discussion Questions

- Which lean management practices do you currently use? What's missing?
- How does your team visualize WIP and quality metrics?
- On a scale of 1-10, how painful are your deployments? What causes the anxiety?
- How would your team score on employee Net Promoter Score?

Action Items for Next Meeting

- Read Chapters 11, 16, and Conclusion (Leadership & Transformation)
- Experiment with visualizing work using a simple kanban board
- Identify one change approval step that could be streamlined
- Observe and document burnout risk factors in your environment
- Run an informal eNPS pulse check with your team
