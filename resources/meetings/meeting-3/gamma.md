Traditional vs Lean Management

- Traditional: Approval-heavy processes with command-and-control
- Lean: Enable and empower teams with lightweight approval
- Change Advisory Boards (CABs) negatively correlated with performance
- Formal external approval processes slow delivery without improving stability
- Peer review (pair programming, code reviews) achieves higher performance

---

Five Lean Management Practices

- Limit Work In Progress (WIP): Expose systemic problems and drive improvement
- Visualize Work: Dashboards and Kanban boards make work visible
- Monitor for Business Decisions: Leverage production data for business choices
- Lightweight Change Approval: Peer review over external approval boards
- Work in Small Batches: Decompose work into pieces completed in less than a week

Lean Management Impact

- 2x better software delivery performance
- 1.8x more generative culture
- 50% less burnout across teams
- 38% to 75% work-life satisfaction improvement (Microsoft Bing case)
- Lean practices create a virtuous cycle reducing stress and improving culture

Deployment Pain: The Burnout Predictor

- Deployment pain is the strongest predictor of burnout
- Fear and anxiety during releases indicate friction between dev and ops
- Manual, error-prone deployment processes create sustained anxiety
- Technical practices eliminate pain at its source, not just symptoms
- Six burnout risk factors: overload, lack of control, insufficient rewards, community breakdown, unfairness, value conflicts

Employee Satisfaction: The Four Pillars

- Meaningful Work: Challenging work that makes a difference
- Learning & Growth: Opportunities to develop skills and advance
- Team Support: Psychological safety and collaboration
- Right Tools: Resources needed to do the job effectively
- High performers are 2.2x more likely to recommend their organization
