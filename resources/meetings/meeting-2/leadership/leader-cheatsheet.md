### Top 3 Key Concepts

1. Continuous Delivery practices drive performance (flow + stability)
2. Loosely coupled architecture enables independent deployability
3. Shift-left security integrates quality without gates

### Backup Questions (If Discussion Stalls)

- "Which CD practice would most reduce our lead time in the next 2 weeks?"
- "Where are we blocked by other teams when deploying?"
- "What’s one way to integrate a security check earlier without slowing flow?"

### Materials Needed

- ✅ [Discussion Guide](discussion-guide.md)
- ✅ Whiteboard to map coupling hotspots
- ✅ [Action Items Tracking Sheet](../handouts/action-items-tracker.md)

### Time-Saving Tips

✅ Do: keep practice inventory crisp; capture 1-2 concrete changes

⚠️ Don’t: deep-dive tooling debates; schedule follow-up if needed
