## Quick Reference (1 Page)

### Meeting Timing (60 Minutes)

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **0-5 min** | Welcome & Check-in | Icebreaker: one technical practice that’s working |
| **5-15 min** | CD Practices Overview | Eight CD practices; keep it high-level |
| **15-25 min** | CD Practices Discussion | Inventory current vs missing practices |
| **25-35 min** | Architecture Independence | Identify coupling hotspots; deploy independently |
| **35-40 min** | Integrating Security | Shift-left collaboration examples |
| **40-45 min** | AI Tool Spotlight | Demo NotebookLM clip to reinforce takeaways |
| **45-55 min** | Action Items & Commitments | One practice + one independence step + one sec pilot |
| **55-60 min** | Preview Meeting 3 | Management & Sustainability focus |

### Top 3 Key Concepts

1. Continuous Delivery practices drive performance (flow + stability)
2. Loosely coupled architecture enables independent deployability
3. Shift-left security integrates quality without gates

### Backup Questions (If Discussion Stalls)

- "Which CD practice would most reduce our lead time in the next 2 weeks?"
- "Where are we blocked by other teams when deploying?"
- "What’s one way to integrate a security check earlier without slowing flow?"

### Materials Needed

- ✅ [Discussion Guide](discussion-guide.md)
- ✅ Whiteboard to map coupling hotspots
- ✅ [Action Items Tracking Sheet](../handouts/action-items-tracker.md)

### Time-Saving Tips

✅ Do: keep practice inventory crisp; capture 1-2 concrete changes

⚠️ Don’t: deep-dive tooling debates; schedule follow-up if needed

### Post-Meeting Follow-Up

- Send notes and commitments; share NotebookLM recap links
- Check in mid-week on practice adoption progress
