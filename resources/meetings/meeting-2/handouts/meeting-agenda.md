## Standard Meeting Format (60 Minutes)

### 1. Welcome & Check-In (5 minutes) | 0:00-0:05

**Objective:** Create psychological safety and set context for technical practices

**Facilitator Actions:**
- ✅ Welcome participants and review meeting objectives
- ✅ Quick round: "What’s one technical practice that’s working well for you now?"
- ✅ Review [Discussion Practices](../../../../activities/discussion-practices.md) ground rules

**Materials:**
- [Attendee Guide](attendee-guide.md) - printed for all participants
- Whiteboard/markers

---

### 2. Key Concepts Review (10 minutes) | 0:05-0:15

**Objective:** Ensure shared understanding of CD practices, architecture, and security integration

**Facilitator Actions:**
- ✅ Brief overview: Eight CD practices (version control, deploy automation, CI, trunk-based development, test automation, test data management, shift-left security, continuous delivery)
- ✅ Loosely coupled architecture: teams can deploy independently
- ✅ Shift-left/integrated security: move from gatekeeping to collaboration

**Participation:**
- Poll: "Can your team deploy independently from other teams?"
- Ask: "Which CD practice is currently your biggest gap?"

---

### 3. Core Discussion (25 minutes) | 0:15-0:40

**Objective:** Apply concepts to your team’s delivery system

**Key Question Reference:** See [key-questions.md#meeting-2](../../key-questions.md#meeting-2)

**Discussion Flow:**

#### Part A: CD Practices (10 min) | 0:15-0:25
1. Which of the eight practices are in place today? Which are missing?
2. What’s your current trunk/branching strategy and how does it affect flow?
3. Where can test automation reduce lead time or restore time fastest?

#### Part B: Architecture Independence (10 min) | 0:25-0:35
1. Can your team deploy without waiting on other teams? If not, why?
2. What’s one coupling hotspot creating delays or risk?
3. What interface or boundary change would increase independence?

#### Part C: Integrating Security (5 min) | 0:35-0:40
1. Where does security currently show up in your flow?
2. What would “shift-left security” look like for your team?

### 4. AI Tool Spotlight (5 minutes) | 0:40-0:45

**Objective:** Showcase NotebookLM for rapid recap and supplementary learning

**Facilitator Actions:**
- ✅ Play a 60-90 second clip from the NotebookLM podcast/video or summarize generated insights
- ✅ Highlight how NotebookLM can reinforce CD practices between sessions
- ✅ Share the direct link to Meeting 2 prompts in `notebooklm/`
- ✅ Capture questions on using AI responsibly for technical learning

**Materials:**
- Laptop with audio output (or speaker)
- [NotebookLM Brief Podcast Prompt](../notebooklm/podcast-brief.md)
- QR code or short URL linking to NotebookLM resources

---

### 5. Action Items & Commitments (10 minutes) | 0:45-0:55

**Objective:** Ensure each participant commits to specific changes

**Facilitator Actions:**
- ✅ Distribute [Action Items Tracking Sheet](action-items-tracker.md)
- ✅ Each participant commits to:
	- One CD practice to implement/strengthen
	- One architecture change to explore for independence
	- One security collaboration to pilot (shift-left)

**Group Commitment:**
- Record commitments in shared document and review at Meeting 3 start

---

### 6. Wrap-Up & Preview (5 minutes) | 0:55-1:00

**Objective:** Reinforce learning and preview management/sustainability focus next

**Facilitator Actions:**
- ✅ Quick round: "What practice will you try this week?"
- ✅ Preview Meeting 3 chapters (7-10)
- ✅ Share preview question
- ✅ Remind about action items due date

**Materials:**
- Meeting 3 preview handout (optional)
- [NotebookLM prompts](../notebooklm/) for Meeting 2 recap

---

## Time Management Tips

**If Running Ahead:**
- Go deeper on trunk-based development and test automation examples
- Whiteboard architecture boundaries to identify independence opportunities

**If Running Behind:**
- Focus on CD practice inventory and one architecture bottleneck
- Replace live NotebookLM demo with take-home link and quick overview
- **Never skip action items**
