## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
Assume listener is skeptical practitioner. Focus Ch 4-6 Accelerate. Create 15-20min critical: (1) CD reality (investment? Legacy retrofits? Trunk-based distributed? ROI?), (2) Loosely coupled gap (coupled legacy, migration years, Conway's Law, DB coupling), (3) Shift-left concerns (understaffed? Training? Compliance?), (4) Context (maturity, regulated, small teams). Discuss challenges and when recommendations don't apply.
```
   - Not everyone wants to be on-call or do operations work

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Practitioners who have attempted CD transformation and encountered real-world challenges. Leaders evaluating whether to invest in these practices. Teams who need realistic expectations, not just promises.

TONE:
Constructively critical. Acknowledge these practices work for many teams while honestly examining barriers, costs, and context-dependencies. Help listeners make informed decisions, not follow prescriptions blindly.

DISCUSSION PREPARATION:
Help listeners discuss:
- What barriers would they face adopting these practices?
- What's their realistic timeline and investment required?
- Which practices apply to their context vs. which don't?
- What prerequisites do they need before starting?
- How to respond to "but our context is different" - when is it valid?
```
