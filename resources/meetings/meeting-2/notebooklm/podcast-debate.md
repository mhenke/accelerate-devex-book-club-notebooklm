## COPY-PASTE PROMPT FOR NOTEBOOKLM

```
Assume listener values multiple perspectives. Focus Ch 4-6 Accelerate. Create 15-20min debate PRO/CON/synthesis: (1) Trunk-based vs feature branches (PRO: integration; CON: review; Synthesis: short-lived?), (2) Microservices vs monolith (PRO: independence; CON: complexity; Synthesis: design over units?), (3) Test automation (PRO: scales; CON: diminishing returns; Synthesis: balance?), (4) Security code vs gates (PRO: early/cheap; CON: expertise). Help identify perspectives that resonate.
