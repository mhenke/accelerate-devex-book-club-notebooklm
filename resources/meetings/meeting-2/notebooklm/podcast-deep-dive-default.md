### Complete Prompt (Copy Everything Below)

```
Assume listener is developer/DevOps for book club. Focus Ch 4-6 Accelerate. Create 15-20min deep dive: (1) CD - 5 principles (quality in, small batches, automate, improve, shared responsibility) + 8 practices (version control, deploy automation, CI, trunk-based, test automation, test data, shift-left security, CD), (2) Loosely coupled arch - teams test/deploy independently, (3) Shift-left security. Discuss practices missing, architecture enabling independence, practice to start.

### Extended Context (For Reference - Do Not Copy to NotebookLM)

**Meeting:** 2 - Technical Excellence
**Chapters:** 4-6
**Format:** Deep Dive (15-20 min)

**Meeting Core Question:**
"Which of our current architectural or security practices create the most friction and dependencies for our teams, and what is the smallest technical change—like improving test automation or adopting trunk-based development—we could make to move toward more independent, 'shift-left' work?"

---

## What to Expect

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Five CD principles and eight technical practices
- ✅ Loosely coupled architecture characteristics and benefits
- ✅ Shift-left security concept and implementation
- ✅ Connection between practices, metrics, and culture
- ✅ Practical examples of each practice

**Key Points Emphasized:**
- CD as the "engine" driving high performance
- Architecture as biggest contributor to CD capability
- Security shift-left improves both speed and security
- Practices drive culture change, not just technical improvement
