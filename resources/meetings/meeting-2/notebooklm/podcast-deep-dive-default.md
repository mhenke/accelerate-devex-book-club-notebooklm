### Extended Context (For Reference - Do Not Copy to NotebookLM)

**Meeting:** 2 - Technical Excellence
**Chapters:** 4-6
**Format:** Deep Dive (15-20 min)

**Meeting Core Question:**
"Which of our current architectural or security practices create the most friction and dependencies for our teams, and what is the smallest technical change—like improving test automation or adopting trunk-based development—we could make to move toward more independent, 'shift-left' work?"

---

## What to Expect

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Five CD principles and eight technical practices
- ✅ Loosely coupled architecture characteristics and benefits
- ✅ Shift-left security concept and implementation
- ✅ Connection between practices, metrics, and culture
- ✅ Practical examples of each practice

**Key Points Emphasized:**
- CD as the "engine" driving high performance
- Architecture as biggest contributor to CD capability
- Security shift-left improves both speed and security
- Practices drive culture change, not just technical improvement
