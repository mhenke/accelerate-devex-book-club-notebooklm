## Best Practices for Facilitators

### Creating Psychological Safety
- Start each meeting with icebreaker (see [leader-cheatsheet.md](meeting-1/leader-cheatsheet.md))
- Use [discussion practices](../activities/discussion-practices.md) ground rules

- Celebrate progress, however small

### Time Management
- Use the 60-minute standard structure
- Keep [meeting agenda](../handouts/meeting-1/meeting-agenda.md) visible for timing
- **Never skip action items segment** - critical for accountability
- If running behind, shorten concepts review, not discussion or commitments

### Maintaining Engagement
- Use round-robin format to hear from everyone
- Balance theory with practical application to your team's work
- Connect discussions to team's DORA metrics and pain points
- Use scenarios from [discussion-guide.md](meeting-1/discussion-guide.md) to make concepts concrete

### Between-Meeting Accountability
- Check in on progress mid-cycle
- Use [action items tracker](../handouts/meeting-1/action-items-tracker.md) to review at start of next meeting
- Follow [between-meetings activities](../activities/between-meetings.md)
