# Key Questions for Accelerate DevEx Book Club

This document contains the central reflection questions that connect all four meetings of the book club. These questions are designed to help your team explore how technical systems, team culture, and organizational performance are deeply intertwined and mutually reinforcing.

## Overall Framing Question {#overall}

Throughout your reading of _Accelerate_, return to this central question:

**"How can we build a virtuous cycle where improving our _technical systems_ enhances our _team culture_, and where an improved culture, in turn, accelerates our ability to deliver value and achieve better outcomes?"**

This question serves as the thread connecting each meeting, reflecting the book's core argument that technical practices, cultural norms, and organizational performance are not separate domains but are mutually reinforcing.

## Meeting 1: The Foundation {#meeting-1}

**Chapters:** 1-3 (Accelerate, Measuring Performance, Measuring and Changing Culture)

### Core Question

**"How do we currently _perceive_ and _measure_ performance, and what would it take to shift our focus from local outputs (like utilization or story points) to the global outcomes of speed and stability that the research proves matter?"**

This question directly challenges the common metrics discussed in Chapter 2 (lines of code, velocity) and prompts the group to evaluate their current practices against the book's evidence-based model. It also connects the "what" of measurement (Ch. 2) to the cultural environment required to use those measurements for learning instead of blame (Ch. 3).

### Discussion Using the Framing Question

- The book argues that high performers don't trade speed for stability; they achieve both. How does this idea challenge the typical assumptions in our organization about the relationship between our systems (speed) and our culture (risk aversion)?
- Chapter 3 introduces the idea that **"you can act your way to a better culture"** by implementing specific practices. What's one technical practice we could adopt that might positively shift our team from a "pathological" or "bureaucratic" culture toward a more "generative" one?

## Meeting 2: The Technical Engine {#meeting-2}

**Chapters:** 4-6 (Technical Practices, Architecture, Integrating Infosec)

### Core Question

**"Which of our current architectural or security practices create the most friction and dependencies for our teams, and what is the smallest technical change—like improving test automation or adopting trunk-based development—we could make to move toward more independent, 'shift-left' work?"**

This question combines the central ideas of Chapters 4, 5, and 6. It asks the group to identify architectural bottlenecks that prevent independent work (a key theme of Chapter 5). It then connects this to specific continuous delivery practices (Ch. 4) and the "shift-left" security model (Ch. 6) as concrete solutions.

### Discussion Using the Framing Question

- The book states that a **loosely coupled architecture** is the biggest contributor to continuous delivery because it enables teams to work independently. How do our current system dependencies create friction and negative cultural patterns (e.g., blame, long meetings, delays) between teams?
- "Shifting left" on security means integrating it into everyone's daily work. How would making security a shared responsibility, enabled by pre-approved tools and libraries, improve both our systems _and_ our culture of collaboration?

## Meeting 3: The Human Systems {#meeting-3}

**Chapters:** 7-10 (Management Practices, Product Development, Making Work Sustainable, Employee Satisfaction)

### Core Question

**"How could we apply Lean principles like limiting WIP and visualizing work to not only improve our delivery flow but also directly reduce 'deployment pain' and burnout, making our work more sustainable and satisfying?"**

This question creates a direct link between the Lean management practices in Chapter 7 (WIP limits, visual management) and the sustainability outcomes in Chapter 9 (deployment pain, burnout). It also incorporates the drivers of employee satisfaction from Chapter 10, such as having the right tools and doing meaningful work.

### Discussion Using the Framing Question

- _Accelerate_ shows that Lean practices like **limiting WIP** and **visualizing work** reduce burnout and foster a generative culture. How could making our work visible create a more supportive, less stressful culture while also improving the flow through our technical systems?
- Employee satisfaction is strongly linked to having the right tools and doing meaningful work. How can we improve the technical systems (e.g., automation, tool choice) to reduce "deployment pain" and burnout, thereby fostering a culture where people feel more engaged and valued?

## Meeting 4: Leadership & Transformation {#meeting-4}

**Chapters:** 11, 16, and Conclusion (Leaders and Managers, High-Performance Leadership case study, wrap-up)

### Core Question

**"What single supportive behavior could our leaders adopt to best enable team experimentation and a generative culture, and what practical steps (like the Obeya rooms or 'catchball' at ING) could we use to make that leadership support visible and effective?"**

This question synthesizes the theory of transformational leadership from Chapter 11 (intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership) with the practical, real-world case study from Chapter 16. It pushes the discussion from abstract leadership qualities to concrete, observable actions that foster the high-trust, learning-focused environment described throughout the book.

### Discussion Using the Framing Question

- **Transformational leadership** indirectly drives performance by enabling better technical and management practices. What is one thing our leadership could do to better support our technical systems (e.g., provide time for improvements) that would also signal a cultural shift towards valuing learning and experimentation?
- Reflecting on the entire book, what is the single smallest change we can make to our technical practices that we believe would start a virtuous cycle, leading to a tangible improvement in our team culture and our ability to deliver value?

## Using These Questions

### For Facilitators

- **Open each meeting** by referencing the overall framing question and the meeting-specific core question
- **Use the discussion prompts** as starting points for conversation when introducing concepts
- **Return to these questions** throughout the discussion to maintain focus on the connection between technical practices and culture
- **Close each meeting** by reflecting on how the discussion illuminated the virtuous cycle between systems and culture

### For Participants

- **Read these questions** before each meeting's assigned chapters
- **Take notes** on examples from your experience that relate to these questions
- **Prepare specific examples** from your work context to share during discussion
- **Reflect on connections** between different meetings' questions to see the holistic transformation picture

### Cross-References

Each meeting's [Discussion Guide](meetings/) contains additional open-ended questions that expand on these core questions. The [Meeting Outlines](meetings/) reference these questions at key points during facilitation.
