- Transformation is not top-down; it's enabling teams to improve
- The virtuous cycle: culture → technical practices → performance → satisfaction

**Final Question:**
"What is the single smallest change we can make that would make our next deployment just a tiny bit less painful?"

**Activities:**
- Develop leadership action plans
- Create team transformation roadmaps (3-6 months)
- Commit to ongoing measurement and improvement
