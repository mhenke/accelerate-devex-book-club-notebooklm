  3. Supportive Leadership
  4. Psychological Safety
  5. Servant Leadership
- ING Netherlands case study: Real-world transformation journey
- Implementing change across organizations
- Measuring and sustaining transformation

**Key Insights:**
- Leaders enable high performance indirectly by supporting technical and lean practices
- Transformation is not top-down; it's enabling teams to improve
- The virtuous cycle: culture → technical practices → performance → satisfaction

**Final Question:**
"What is the single smallest change we can make that would make our next deployment just a tiny bit less painful?"

**Activities:**
- Develop leadership action plans
- Create team transformation roadmaps (3-6 months)
- Commit to ongoing measurement and improvement
- Plan continuation beyond the book club
- **AI Tool Spotlight:** GitHub Copilot (AI pair programming to accelerate development)

**Post-Book Club Continuation:**
