## Important Principles

### 1. Psychological Safety First
- These assessments are for learning, not judgment
- Low scores indicate opportunities, not failures
- Share results only when safe to do so

### 2. Focus on Systems, Not People
- Assess team capabilities, not individual performance
- Look for systemic issues, not blame
- Improvements benefit everyone

### 3. Start Small
- Don't try to improve everything at once
- Pick 1-2 high-impact capabilities to focus on
- Build momentum with early wins

### 4. Measure to Learn
- These assessments help you understand current state
- Track progress over time, not against others
- Use data to drive improvement, not punishment

### 5. Capabilities Over Tools
- Focus on what you can do, not what you buy
- Technical practices are more important than specific tools
- Build capabilities that transcend technology choices
