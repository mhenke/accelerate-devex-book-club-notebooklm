## Assessment Integration Examples

### Example 1: Connecting Metrics to Capabilities

**Scenario:** Deployment frequency hasn't improved

**Approach:**
1. Review [24 Capabilities](24-capabilities-assessment.md) scores for:
   - #2 Deployment automation
   - #3 Continuous integration
   - #4 Trunk-based development
2. Identify lowest-scoring capability
3. Focus improvement efforts there
4. Remeasure DORA metric after 2-4 weeks

### Example 2: Culture-Practice Connection

**Scenario:** Culture assessment shows bureaucratic patterns

**Approach:**
1. Review [Culture Worksheet](culture-assessment-worksheet.md) examples
2. Identify specific behaviors (e.g., information hoarding)
3. Select practice from [24 Capabilities](24-capabilities-assessment.md) that addresses it (e.g., #19 Visual work displays)
4. Track culture changes alongside practice implementation

### Example 3: Prioritizing Improvements

**Scenario:** Many low capability scores, unsure where to start

**Approach:**
1. Cross-reference [24 Capabilities](24-capabilities-assessment.md) with [DORA Metrics](dora-metrics-template.md)
2. Identify capability that most impacts weakest DORA metric
3. Consider difficulty vs. impact using assessment scoring
4. Start with high-impact, lower-difficulty capability

## Best Practices

### For Effective Assessment

**Do:**
- ✅ Complete assessments as team, not just individuals
- ✅ Provide specific evidence for ratings
- ✅ Revisit assessments regularly (quarterly minimum)
- ✅ Use data for learning, not blame
- ✅ Connect assessment results to action items

**Don't:**
- ⚠️ Use assessments for individual performance reviews
- ⚠️ Compare teams publicly without context
- ⚠️ Assess once and forget
- ⚠️ Focus only on scores, ignore qualitative insights
- ⚠️ Try to improve everything at once

### For Psychological Safety

- Frame assessments as "current state" not "failure"
- Emphasize continuous improvement over perfection
- Celebrate progress, however small
- Use anonymized data when sharing broadly
- Create safe space for honest self-assessment

### For Data Quality

- Measure consistently (same time, same method)
- Document measurement approach
- Include qualitative context with numbers
- Validate data with team before sharing
- Adjust for organizational changes/context
