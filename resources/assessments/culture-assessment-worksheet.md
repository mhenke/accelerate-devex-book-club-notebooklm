# Culture Assessment Worksheet

## Purpose

This worksheet helps you identify your organization's culture type using **Westrum's Organizational Culture Model** from *Accelerate*. Culture is measurable, predictive of performance, and can be intentionally improved.

## Why Culture Matters

**Key Research Finding:** Generative culture predicts:
- Software delivery performance (lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, change failure rate)
- Organizational performance (profitability, productivity, market share)
- Employee satisfaction and reduced burnout

**The Good News:** "You can act your way to a better culture" by implementing specific technical and lean practices.

## Westrum's Three Culture Types

### Pathological (Power-Oriented)
**Characteristics:**
- Low cooperation, with "me first" mentality
- Messengers are "shot" for bringing bad news
- Responsibilities are shirked
- Bridging between teams is discouraged
- Failure is covered up or punished
- Novelty is crushed

**In Practice:**
- Information is hoarded for political advantage
- Teams compete rather than collaborate
- Leaders focus on control and blame
- Innovation is risky and discouraged

---

### Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)
**Characteristics:**
- Modest cooperation
- Messengers are ignored
- Narrow responsibilities (not my job)
- Bridging tolerated but not rewarded
- Failure leads to justice-seeking
- Novelty creates problems

**In Practice:**
- Process and rules take priority over outcomes
- Departmental silos with limited cross-team work
- Leaders follow procedures and protect turf
- Change is slow and requires extensive approvals

---

### Generative (Performance-Oriented)
**Characteristics:**
- High cooperation
- Messengers are trained (we want to hear bad news)
- Risks are shared
- Bridging is rewarded
- Failure leads to inquiry
- Novelty is implemented

**In Practice:**
- Information flows freely where needed
- Teams collaborate across boundaries
- Leaders focus on mission accomplishment
- Innovation and experimentation are encouraged

---

### 5. Failure Response
**What happens when something goes wrong?**

- ☐ **Pathological:** Failure is covered up, hidden, or someone is blamed/punished

- ☐ **Generative:** Failure leads to inquiry, learning, and systemic improvement

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

### 6. Innovation & Novelty
**How does your organization respond to new ideas?**

## Scoring Your Culture Assessment

Count your responses in each category:

- **Pathological (Power-Oriented):** _____ / 6
- **Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented):** _____ / 6
- **Generative (Performance-Oriented):** _____ / 6

### Your Dominant Culture Type

The category with the most responses represents your **dominant culture**:

☐ **Pathological** - Focus on building psychological safety as the foundation

☐ **Bureaucratic** - Focus on empowering teams and reducing approval overhead

☐ **Generative** - Focus on sustaining and scaling these practices

### Mixed Culture

If your responses are split across multiple types, that's normal! Most organizations have:
- Different culture types in different departments
- Culture in transition from one type to another
- Pockets of generative culture within bureaucratic structures

1. **Continuous Delivery Practices**
   - Version control for everything
   - Automated testing
   - Trunk-based development
   - Continuous integration

2. **Lean Management**
   - Limit WIP to expose problems
   - Visualize work
   - Lightweight change approval (peer review)

3. **Architecture**
   - Loosely coupled services
   - Team autonomy
   - Independent deployability

4. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Proactive monitoring
   - Production telemetry
   - Fast feedback loops
