# Culture Assessment Worksheet

## Purpose

This worksheet helps you identify your organization's culture type using **Westrum's Organizational Culture Model** from *Accelerate*. Culture is measurable, predictive of performance, and can be intentionally improved.

## Why Culture Matters

**Key Research Finding:** Generative culture predicts:
- Software delivery performance (lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, change failure rate)
- Organizational performance (profitability, productivity, market share)
- Employee satisfaction and reduced burnout

**The Good News:** "You can act your way to a better culture" by implementing specific technical and lean practices.

## Westrum's Three Culture Types

### Pathological (Power-Oriented)
**Characteristics:**
- Low cooperation, with "me first" mentality
- Messengers are "shot" for bringing bad news
- Responsibilities are shirked
- Bridging between teams is discouraged
- Failure is covered up or punished
- Novelty is crushed

**In Practice:**
- Information is hoarded for political advantage
- Teams compete rather than collaborate
- Leaders focus on control and blame
- Innovation is risky and discouraged

---

### Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)
**Characteristics:**
- Modest cooperation
- Messengers are ignored
- Narrow responsibilities (not my job)
- Bridging tolerated but not rewarded
- Failure leads to justice-seeking
- Novelty creates problems

**In Practice:**
- Process and rules take priority over outcomes
- Departmental silos with limited cross-team work
- Leaders follow procedures and protect turf
- Change is slow and requires extensive approvals

---

### Generative (Performance-Oriented)
**Characteristics:**
- High cooperation
- Messengers are trained (we want to hear bad news)
- Risks are shared
- Bridging is rewarded
- Failure leads to inquiry
- Novelty is implemented

**In Practice:**
- Information flows freely where needed
- Teams collaborate across boundaries
- Leaders focus on mission accomplishment
- Innovation and experimentation are encouraged

---

## Assessment Questions

For each behavior below, select which culture type best describes your organization:

### 1. Information Flow
**How does information flow in your organization?**

_This measures whether people actively seek and share information across boundaries, or whether information is controlled, restricted, or flows only through official channels._

**Examples:**
- **Generative:** Engineers proactively check dashboards, share incident learnings in Slack, and reach out to other teams for context
- **Bureaucratic:** Information distributed only through official meetings or email chains with limited visibility
- **Pathological:** Critical details kept secret, data access restricted, information used as leverage

- ☐ **Pathological:** Information is hoarded, withheld, or manipulated for political gain
- ☐ **Bureaucratic:** Information flows through formal channels with narrow distribution
- ☐ **Generative:** Information flows freely to anyone who needs it to do their job

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

### 2. Messenger Treatment
**What happens when someone brings bad news (outages, bugs, delays)?**

_This measures psychological safety—whether people can raise problems without fear of blame, or if reporting issues damages their reputation._

**Examples:**
- **Generative:** When an engineer reports "We'll miss the deadline," the team says "Thanks for raising this early, let's adjust scope"
- **Bureaucratic:** Bad news is acknowledged but ignored, no consequences but also no action
- **Pathological:** Person reporting the problem is blamed ("Why didn't you work harder?") or avoided by others

- ☐ **Pathological:** Messengers are blamed, punished, or their careers suffer
- ☐ **Bureaucratic:** Messengers are listened to but little action is taken
- ☐ **Generative:** Messengers are valued, and the organization learns from bad news

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

### 3. Responsibility
**How do teams handle shared responsibilities?**

_This measures whether teams take collective ownership or avoid accountability by narrowly defining their roles._

**Examples:**
- **Generative:** When production breaks, multiple teams coordinate to fix it regardless of who "owns" that component
- **Bureaucratic:** Teams help only within their specific job scope, requiring tickets or formal requests for anything outside it
- **Pathological:** Teams actively avoid taking on problems, saying "That's not our code" or "Not my team's responsibility"

- ☐ **Pathological:** Responsibilities are shirked ("not my problem")
- ☐ **Bureaucratic:** Narrow job descriptions ("not in my job description")
- ☐ **Generative:** Risks and responsibilities are shared across teams

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

### 4. Cross-Team Collaboration
**How does your organization treat people who bridge between teams or departments?**

_This measures whether cross-functional work is valued or whether organizational silos prevent effective collaboration._

**Examples:**
- **Generative:** Engineers who help other teams are explicitly recognized in performance reviews; cross-team projects are career accelerators
- **Bureaucratic:** Helping other teams is allowed but doesn't count toward your own team's metrics or goals
- **Pathological:** Working with other teams is seen as "wasting time" or "not focusing on your real work"

- ☐ **Pathological:** Bridging is discouraged; stay in your lane
- ☐ **Bureaucratic:** Bridging is tolerated but not rewarded
- ☐ **Generative:** Bridging is rewarded and seen as essential

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

### 5. Failure Response
**What happens when something goes wrong?**

_This measures whether failures are opportunities to learn and improve systems, or if they trigger blame, punishment, or rule enforcement._

**Examples:**
- **Generative:** Blameless postmortems ask "What systemic factors contributed?" and result in automated checks or process improvements
- **Bureaucratic:** Incident reports focus on which policy was violated, little learning or system change occurs
- **Pathological:** After an outage, someone is quietly removed from the project or their career is damaged

- ☐ **Pathological:** Failure is covered up, hidden, or someone is blamed/punished
- ☐ **Bureaucratic:** Failure leads to justice-seeking and finding who violated rules
- ☐ **Generative:** Failure leads to inquiry, learning, and systemic improvement

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________

---

### 6. Innovation & Novelty
**How does your organization respond to new ideas?**

_This measures whether innovation and experimentation are encouraged or whether new approaches are discouraged or heavily bureaucratic._

**Examples:**
- **Generative:** When someone proposes trying a new tool, the response is "Let's run a small experiment and measure results"
- **Bureaucratic:** New ideas require extensive approval processes, committees, and business cases before any pilot can happen
- **Pathological:** Suggesting changes is seen as criticism; innovators are told "If you don't like it, leave"

- ☐ **Pathological:** Novelty is crushed; stick to the way we've always done it
- ☐ **Bureaucratic:** Novelty creates problems and requires extensive approval
- ☐ **Generative:** Novelty is implemented; experimentation is encouraged

**Evidence/Examples:**
_______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________

## Scoring Your Culture Assessment

Count your responses in each category:

- **Pathological (Power-Oriented):** _____ / 6
- **Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented):** _____ / 6
- **Generative (Performance-Oriented):** _____ / 6

### Your Dominant Culture Type

The category with the most responses represents your **dominant culture**:

☐ **Pathological** - Focus on building psychological safety as the foundation

☐ **Bureaucratic** - Focus on empowering teams and reducing approval overhead

☐ **Generative** - Focus on sustaining and scaling these practices

### Mixed Culture

If your responses are split across multiple types, that's normal! Most organizations have:
- Different culture types in different departments
- Culture in transition from one type to another
- Pockets of generative culture within bureaucratic structures
