# 24 Capabilities Self-Assessment

_Use this as a checklist for identifying improvement opportunities_

## Overview

The research presented in "Accelerate" identifies 24 key capabilities that drive high performance in technology organizations. Unlike maturity models with fixed endpoints, this capabilities framework supports:

- **Continuous improvement** - No final destination, always room to grow
- **Context-specific application** - Customize to your team's unique situation
- **Direct link to outcomes** - Each capability correlates with measurable business results

## How to Use This Assessment

### When to Use

- **Pre-Meeting 1:** Establish your baseline before starting the book club
- **Between Meetings:** Track progress on capabilities discussed in each session
- **Post-Book Club:** Measure improvement and identify next focus areas
- **Quarterly:** Regular check-ins to monitor transformation progress

### Scoring Guide

Rate your team on each capability using this scale:

- **1 - Not Started:** We don't practice this at all
- **2 - Ad Hoc:** Some individuals or teams do this inconsistently
- **3 - Defined:** We have processes in place, but not everyone follows them
- **4 - Managed:** Consistent practice across most teams with metrics
- **5 - Optimizing:** Continuous improvement with data-driven refinement

### Instructions

1. **Individual Assessment:** Each team member rates capabilities independently
2. **Team Discussion:** Compare scores and discuss differences in perception
3. **Prioritization:** Select 2-3 capabilities to focus on based on:
   - Lowest scores (biggest gaps)
   - Highest impact (based on your context)
   - Easiest to implement (quick wins)
4. **Action Planning:** For each prioritized capability, identify specific next steps
