# NotebookLM Video Generation Prompts (Updated)

_Accelerate DevEx Book Club Meeting Videos - Based on Actual Book Content_

## Video Settings Recommendation

- **Length:** Select "Longer" for comprehensive coverage (typically 15-25 minutes)
- **Style:** Conversational discussion between two AI hosts

## Meeting 1: Laying the Foundation â€“ The Myth and the Measurement

### Focus Prompt

"Focus on chapters 1-3 of Accelerate by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim. Cover the four DORA metrics as practical measurement tools (delivery lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore service, change fail rate), debunk the speed vs stability trade-off myth, and introduce Westrum's organizational culture typology."

### Topic Focus

"Just discuss how high performers achieve 46 times more frequent deployments, 440 times faster lead time, and 170 times faster recovery without sacrificing stability, plus explain the three culture types: pathological, bureaucratic, and generative."

### Target Audience

"Explain to software developers and DevOps practitioners preparing for a book club discussion who want to understand how to measure delivery performance and recognize culture patterns that impact their daily work."

### Additional Context

- Emphasize this is based on 23,000+ survey responses from 2,000+ organizations over 4 years
- Use relatable examples of deployment anxiety and culture behaviors
- Connect metrics to daily developer workflows and team dynamics
- Frame culture as measurable and changeable, not mystical

## Meeting 2: Technical Excellence & Continuous Delivery

### Focus Prompt

"Focus on chapters 4-6 of Accelerate, covering the technical practices that enable continuous delivery: version control, automated testing, continuous integration, trunk-based development, deployment automation, loosely coupled architecture, and shift-left security practices."

### Topic Focus

"Just discuss how continuous delivery acts as the 'engine that drives all of this' performance, why loosely coupled architecture enables team independence, and how building security in improves both speed and security quality."

### Target Audience

"Explain to engineering teams and technical leaders who want to understand the connection between technical practices and organizational culture, and how architecture decisions impact team productivity and autonomy."

### Additional Context

- Explain the five CD principles: build quality in, work small batches, automate repetition, continuous improvement, everyone responsible
- Use Conway's Law and the inverse Conway maneuver concepts
- Address the "wall of confusion" between development and operations
- Connect technical practices to culture change through behavioral implementation

## Meeting 3: Management, Product Development & Sustainability

### Focus Prompt

"Focus on chapters 7-10 of Accelerate, discussing lean management practices like WIP limits and visual displays, lean product development with customer feedback and small batches, deployment pain as a sustainability signal, and the connection between technical practices and employee satisfaction."

### Topic Focus

"Just discuss how lightweight change approval processes outperform change advisory boards, why working in small batches with customer feedback creates better products, and how continuous delivery practices reduce burnout and improve work-life balance."

### Target Audience

"Explain to engineering managers, product managers, and team leads who want to understand how management practices and product development approaches impact both delivery performance and team wellbeing."

### Additional Context

- Include Microsoft example: CD practices improved work-life balance scores from 38% to 75%
- Explain the six organizational risk factors that predict burnout
- Connect lean management to improved culture and reduced anxiety
- Address team experimentation authority and its impact on innovation

## Meeting 4: Leadership, Research Methods & Transformation

### Focus Prompt

"Focus on chapter 11 and chapter 16 of Accelerate, covering the five dimensions of transformational leadership (vision, inspirational communication, intellectual stimulation, supportive leadership, personal recognition) and the ING Netherlands case study showing high-performance leadership practices in action."

### Topic Focus

"Just discuss how transformational leaders enable technical and lean practices rather than directly driving performance, and explore ING's transformation through Obeya rooms, tribe/squad structure, catchball communication, and 'make it your own' philosophy."

### Target Audience

"Explain to current and aspiring technical leaders, engineering managers, and transformation champions who want practical examples of how leadership behaviors enable high-performing technology organizations."

### Additional Context

- Emphasize that leadership impact is indirect - through enabling practices, not commanding outcomes
- Include ING's specific practices: visual management, daily stand-ups, coaching culture, standard work
- Address the transformation mindset: learn how to learn, practice discipline and patience
- End with the key reflection: "What's the smallest change to make our next deployment less painful?"

## General Video Guidelines

### Consistent Themes Across All Episodes

- These insights come from rigorous 4-year research study with 23,000+ responses
- High performance means achieving both speed AND stability simultaneously - no trade-offs
- Technical practices and culture are interconnected - you can "act your way to better culture"
- Focus on capabilities (continuous improvement) not maturity models (fixed endpoints)
- The 24 capabilities framework provides concrete areas for improvement

### Video Tone and Style

- **Evidence-Based:** Constantly reference the research methodology and sample size
- **Practical:** Include concrete examples from real organizations (Microsoft, ING, Netflix, Amazon)
- **Developer-Focused:** Use examples that resonate with daily software development work
- **Research-Grounded:** Distinguish between correlation and prediction in findings
- **Encouraging:** Frame current challenges as normal parts of transformation journey

### Episode Structure Suggestions

1. **Opening:** Brief recap of research foundation and episode's place in transformation journey
2. **Key Research Findings:** Present specific data points and correlations from the studies
3. **Real-World Examples:** Concrete applications from case studies and industry examples
4. **Culture Connection:** How technical practices impact team culture and vice versa
5. **Discussion Prep:** Thought-provoking questions for book club meeting
6. **Actionable Practices:** Specific experiments teams can try from the 24 capabilities
7. **Closing:** Preview next episode and connection to overall transformation

### Key Research Data Points to Include

- **Meeting 1:** 46x, 440x, 170x performance differences; three culture types with specific behaviors
- **Meeting 2:** CD as biggest predictor of performance; architecture enabling team independence
- **Meeting 3:** Change boards negatively correlated with performance; burnout risk factors and mitigation
- **Meeting 4:** Leadership characteristics predicting performance; ING's specific transformation practices
