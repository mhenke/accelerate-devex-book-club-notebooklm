## Running the Meeting

### Opening Strong (5 minutes)

**Welcome:**
- Greet participants as they arrive
- Start on time (respect people's schedules)
- State meeting objectives clearly

**Icebreaker:**
- Use a relevant, low-stakes question
- Model vulnerability by going first
- Keep it brief (30-60 seconds per person)

**Ground Rules:**
- Review [discussion practices](discussion-practices.md)
- Emphasize psychological safety
- Get explicit agreement on confidentiality

### Core Discussion (25 minutes)

**Launch Questions:**
- Start with an open-ended question
- Wait 5-10 seconds for someone to speak (silence is okay)
- Acknowledge first response: "Thank you for starting us off"

**Facilitate Discussion:**
- Listen more than you talk (aim for 80/20 ratio)
- Track who has/hasn't spoken
- Connect ideas: "That builds on what Sarah said..."
- Redirect tangents: "That's interesting—let's capture it for later"

**Deepen Learning:**
- Ask for examples: "Can someone share when they experienced this?"
- Challenge: "What evidence would change your mind?"
- Apply: "What would this look like at your organization?"
- Synthesize: "I'm hearing two themes..."

### Managing Dynamics

**If Discussion Lags:**
1. Think-pair-share: "Take 2 minutes to write, then discuss with partner"
2. Poll: "Raise hands if you've experienced..."
3. Provide scenario: "Imagine you deployed 3x per day..."
4. Share your example to seed discussion

**If Someone Dominates:**
1. Thank them: "Thanks for sharing—let's hear from others"
2. Redirect: "Let's get perspective from someone we haven't heard from"
3. Use structure: "Let's go around—30 seconds each"
4. Speak privately during break if needed

**If Conflict Arises:**
1. Acknowledge: "I hear different perspectives"
2. Explore: "What experiences led to these views?"
3. Find common ground: "What do you both agree on?"
4. Refocus on learning: "What would we need to know to resolve this?"

**If It Becomes Negative:**
1. Validate: "These frustrations are real"
2. Reframe: "What system led to this?"
3. Redirect: "What's one small change we could test?"
4. Return to evidence: "What does the research suggest?"

### Closing Effectively (15 minutes)

**Action Items (10 minutes):**
- Distribute tracking sheets
- Each person writes and shares commitments
- Record all commitments visibly
- Set clear deadline (next meeting)

**Wrap-Up (5 minutes):**
- Quick round: "One key takeaway"
- Preview next meeting chapters
- Share any prep materials
- Thank participants for engagement

## After the Meeting

### Immediate (Within 24 hours):
- [ ] Send meeting notes using [template](../templates/meeting-notes-template.md)
- [ ] Share action items commitments document
- [ ] Send next meeting prep materials
- [ ] Reflect on what went well/poorly (personal notes)

### Week After:
- [ ] Check in with participants who seemed disengaged
- [ ] Share any promised resources
- [ ] Post midpoint reminder about action items
- [ ] Prepare for next meeting

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Attendance
**Prevention:** Send reminders, make meetings valuable, schedule consistently
**Response:** Proceed if 3+ people; share notes with absent members; consider time/format changes

### Participants Haven't Read
**Prevention:** Share summaries, podcasts, make reading light
**Response:** Don't shame; provide 2-min chapter summaries; use handouts to guide discussion

### Meeting Runs Long
**Prevention:** Strict timeboxes, prioritize questions, have timer visible
**Response:** Skip low-priority items, extend core discussion if needed, NEVER skip action items

### Psychological Safety Issues
**Prevention:** Model vulnerability, enforce ground rules, start small
**Response:** Address publicly if visible (e.g., interrupting), privately for sensitive matters, restart ground rules if needed

### Disruptive Participant
**Prevention:** Clear expectations upfront, private pre-meeting conversation if concerns
**Response:** Redirect in meeting, speak privately during break, escalate to organizer if persistent

### Technical Difficulties (Virtual)
**Prevention:** Test beforehand, have backup plan, start 5 min early for tech check
**Response:** Have phone dial-in backup, use chat if audio fails, reschedule only as last resort

## Self-Improvement as Facilitator

## Facilitator Mindset

**Remember:**

**You don't need all the answers.** Your job is to ask good questions and create space for participants to discover insights together.

**Everyone brings expertise.** Each participant has valuable experiences. Your role is to surface and connect them.

**Process over perfection.** Following the structure matters more than covering everything. Trust the process.

**It's about them, not you.** Success is measured by participant growth, not by your performance.

**Model the culture you want.** If you want generative culture in discussions, demonstrate high cooperation, welcome messengers, share risks, and seek information actively.

**Questions about facilitation?** Reach out to other facilitators, review [discussion practices](discussion-practices.md), or adapt based on your group's needs.

**Most important:** Show up prepared, stay curious, and create conditions for learning. You've got this.
