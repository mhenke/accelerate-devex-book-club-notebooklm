# Between-Meetings Activities

Structured activities to maintain momentum and deepen learning between book club meetings.

## Purpose

Between-meeting activities help participants:
- Apply concepts to their work context
- Gather evidence for discussion
- Build new habits aligned with Accelerate research
- Maintain engagement over the 2-month program

## Activity Types

### 1. Measurement & Observation

**Track a DORA Metric**
- Choose one metric (deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, or change fail rate)
- Record data for 2 weeks
- Note what makes measurement difficult
- Bring findings to next meeting

**Culture Pattern Recognition**
- Observe 3-5 interactions that demonstrate culture
- Note: Pathological, Bureaucratic, or Generative behaviors
- Document specific examples (anonymize if needed)
- Reflect on what drives these patterns

### 2. Team Experiments

**Small Process Improvements**

- Design a small experiment (1-2 weeks)
- Track impact with before/after data
- Share results at next meeting

**Lunch & Learn**
- Host informal 30-minute session with team
- Share 1-2 key concepts from chapters
- Gather reactions and questions
- Report themes back to book club

### 3. Reflection & Writing

**Personal Learning Journal**
- After each meeting, write:
  - Most surprising insight
  - One thing I disagree with (and why)
  - How this applies to my current project
  - One action I'll take this week

**Case Study Development**
- Document a recent deployment or incident
- Analyze through DORA metrics lens
- Identify what would change with different practices
- Share anonymized version with group

### 4. Peer Conversations

**Cross-Team Interviews**

## Activity Guidelines

### Make It Manageable
- Budget 1-2 hours per week
- Focus on observation over perfection
- Use simple tools (spreadsheet, notes app)
- Don't let activities become burdensome

### Keep It Real
- Use actual work, not hypothetical scenarios
- Anonymize sensitive information
- Focus on systems and processes, not people
- Share failures as freely as successes

### Share Learning
- Bring artifacts to meetings (data, notes, photos)
- Tell stories, not just facts
- Connect observations to book concepts
- Ask group for interpretation help

## Tips for Success

**Start Small**
- Week 1: Just observe and take notes
- Week 2: Start measuring one thing
- Don't try to do everything at once

**Make It Visible**
- Put sticky notes on monitor
- Add recurring calendar events
- Share goals with team

**Connect to Work**
- Align activities with current projects
- Use book club as excuse to try new things
- Frame as learning, not critique

**Ask for Help**
- Post questions in book club channel
- Request facilitator guidance
- Brainstorm with peers
