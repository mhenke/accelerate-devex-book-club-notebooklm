## Discussion Practices

**File:** [discussion-practices.md](discussion-practices.md)

### What It Contains

Guidelines for facilitating productive, inclusive, and action-oriented discussions:
- Creating psychological safety
- Ground rules for respectful dialogue
- Handling difficult conversations
- Time management techniques
- Encouraging balanced participation
- Moving from complaint to action

### When to Use

**Before each meeting (prep):**
- Review facilitation techniques
- Prepare psychological safety opening
- Plan participation strategies

**During each meeting:**
- Reference ground rules at start
- Apply techniques when discussion stalls or becomes unproductive
- Use when managing dominant voices or drawing out quiet participants

**After each meeting:**
- Reflect on what facilitation techniques worked
- Plan adjustments for next meeting

### Meeting-Specific Application

#### Meeting 0 (Kickoff) - Optional
- **Focus:** Setting expectations and building excitement
- **Key technique:** Create welcoming atmosphere, emphasize learning over judgment
- **Challenge:** Participants may be skeptical about time commitment
- **Solution:** Share success stories, emphasize small experiments

#### Meeting 1 (Foundation)
- **Focus:** Establishing psychological safety for honest assessment
- **Key technique:** Normalize sharing deployment anxiety stories
- **Challenge:** Team may be defensive about current metrics
- **Solution:** Frame as learning, not blame

#### Meeting 2 (Technical Excellence)
- **Focus:** Balancing technical depth with accessibility
- **Key technique:** Use scenarios to make abstract practices concrete
- **Challenge:** Technical discussions may exclude some participants
- **Solution:** Pair technical experts with less experienced members

#### Meeting 3 (Management & Sustainability)
- **Focus:** Creating safety to discuss burnout and team health
- **Key technique:** Vulnerability modeling by facilitator or leader
- **Challenge:** Sensitive personal topics (burnout, dissatisfaction)
- **Solution:** Emphasize confidentiality, focus on systemic factors

#### Meeting 4 (Leadership & Transformation)
- **Focus:** Honest assessment of leadership effectiveness
- **Key technique:** Use third-party examples (ING case study) before self-assessment
- **Challenge:** Discussing leadership gaps without blame
- **Solution:** Focus on behaviors and systems, not individuals

### What It Contains

Structured activities, experiments, and reflection questions to maintain momentum:
- Metric tracking exercises
- Small practice experiments
- Team observation prompts
- Reflection questions
- Progress check-ins

### When to Use

**Between all meetings** to:
- Maintain engagement during 2-week gaps
- Track progress on commitments
- Deepen understanding through practice
- Build evidence for discussions

### Meeting-Specific Activity Guide

#### After Meeting 0 / Before Meeting 1 (Week 0)

**Primary activities:**
- **Get the Book** - Purchase or obtain _Accelerate_

## Activity Integration with Assessments

### Continuous Activities

Use these throughout the book club:

| Activity | Assessment Tool | Frequency |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| DORA metrics tracking | [dora-metrics-template.md](../assessments/dora-metrics-template.md) | Ongoing (every deployment/incident) |
| Culture observations | [culture-assessment-worksheet.md](../assessments/culture-assessment-worksheet.md) | Weekly |
| Practice experiments | [24-capabilities-assessment.md](../assessments/24-capabilities-assessment.md) | Per experiment |

### Meeting Check-Ins

At start of each meeting:
1. **Quick round:** One thing you tried since last meeting
2. **Progress review:** Review action items tracker from previous meeting
3. **Celebrate wins:** Acknowledge progress, however small
4. **Identify blockers:** Surface challenges and offer help

---

## Best Practices for Between-Meeting Activities

### Do:
- ✅ Keep experiments small (1-2 weeks max)
- ✅ Measure impact with data when possible
- ✅ Document learnings immediately (don't rely on memory)
- ✅ Share progress and blockers with team
- ✅ Adapt activities to your context

### Don't:
- ⚠️ Try to change everything at once
- ⚠️ Skip measurement/observation (defeats the purpose)
- ⚠️ Work in isolation (collaborate with team)
- ⚠️ Treat activities as homework (should enhance work, not burden it)
- ⚠️ Give up if first experiment fails (iterate and learn)

---

## Maintaining Momentum

### Week-by-Week Cadence

**Week 1:**
- Meeting 1 → Commitments → Start tracking

**Week 2:**
- Mid-cycle check-in → Share observations → Prepare for Meeting 2

**Week 3:**
- Meeting 2 → Commitments → Start experiments

**Week 4:**
- Mid-cycle check-in → Share experiment results → Adjust

**Week 5:**
- Meeting 3 → Commitments → WIP/visualization experiments

**Week 6:**
- Mid-cycle check-in → Compile 7-week data → Prepare roadmap

**Week 7:**
- Meeting 4 → Transformation roadmap → Post-book club planning

### Accountability Mechanisms

1. **Action Items Tracker** - Individual commitment tracking
2. **Mid-cycle check-ins** - Quick async or sync progress sharing
3. **Meeting 2/3/4 opening** - Review previous commitments
4. **Peer support** - Buddy system for experiments
