## Meeting Overview

Today we explore:
- ✅ The four DORA metrics that define high-performing teams
- ✅ Why speed and stability go together (not trade off)
- ✅ How organizational culture impacts delivery performance

---

## Key Question for Today

> **"How do we currently _perceive_ and _measure_ performance, and what would it take to shift our focus from local outputs (like utilization or story points) to the global outcomes of speed and stability that the research proves matter?"**

---

## The Four DORA Metrics

### 1. Lead Time for Changes
**What it measures:** Time from code committed to code successfully running in production

**High performers:** < 1 hour
**Your team:** ________________

**What slows you down?** _________________________________

---

### 2. Deployment Frequency
**What it measures:** How often you deploy code to production

**High performers:** Multiple times per day
**Your team:** ________________

**What prevents more frequent deployments?** _________________________________

---

### 3. Time to Restore Service
**What it measures:** How long it takes to restore service after incident

**High performers:** < 1 hour
**Your team:** ________________

**What slows recovery?** _________________________________

---

### 4. Change Fail Rate
**What it measures:** Percentage of deployments causing production failures

**High performers:** 0-15%
**Your team:** ________________

**What typically causes failures?** _________________________________

---

## Speed + Stability: No Trade-Off

### Research Findings

High performers achieve:
- **46x** more frequent deployments
- **440x** faster lead time
- **170x** faster recovery time
- **5x** lower change fail rate

### Your Experience

Think of your last deployment:

**Anxiety level (1-10):** _____

**Why?** _______________________________________________________

________________________________________________________________

### Key Insight

> Deployment anxiety is a **signal of process problems**, not personal failure.

## Westrum's Organizational Culture Types

Check the culture you observe most often in your organization:

### ⬜ Pathological (Power-Oriented)
- Low cooperation across groups
- Messengers "shot" for bringing bad news
- Responsibilities shirked when failure occurs
- Information hoarded for political reasons

**Example I've seen:** _________________________________________

________________________________________________________________

### ⬜ Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)
- Modest cooperation between departments
- Messengers neglected (not welcomed or punished)
- Responsibility compartmentalized by departments
- Information flows through official channels

**Example I've seen:** _________________________________________

________________________________________________________________

### ⬜ Generative (Performance-Oriented)
- High cooperation across organization
- Messengers trained and developed
- Risks and responsibilities shared
- Information sought actively and shared freely

**Example I've seen:** _________________________________________
