## What Are Handouts?

Handouts are printable resources designed to support book club meetings:

- **Attendee Guides** - Workbooks for participants with fill-in sections
- **Meeting Agendas** - Structured timelines for facilitators
- **Action Items Trackers** - Templates for tracking commitments
- **Topic Handouts** - Deep dives into specific concepts

## Usage

These materials are designed to be:
- **Printed** - For in-person meetings
- **Distributed digitally** - For remote participants
- **Annotated** - Participants write directly on them during discussions
- **Referenced later** - Track progress and commitments over time

## Organization

Each meeting's handouts folder contains both facilitator resources (agendas, tracking) and participant resources (guides, worksheets).
