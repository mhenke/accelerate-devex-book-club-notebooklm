### Final Validation

- ⬜ Fix any broken links

## Quick Guide for Completing Remaining Work

### Creating README.md for Meetings 2-4

Use `meetings/meeting-1/README.md` as template. Update:
1. Title and week number
2. Chapter numbers
3. Key Concepts section
4. Action items
5. Links to next meeting

### Creating leader-cheatsheet.md for Meetings 2-4

Use `meetings/meeting-1/leader-cheatsheet.md` as template. Update:
1. Title
2. Timing breakdown (adjust discussion topics)
3. Top 3 Key Concepts (from outline.md or chapter-notes.md)
4. Common Misconceptions (from book content)
5. Icebreaker question (relevant to meeting topic)
6. Backup questions (specific to chapters)

### Creating discussion-guide.md for Meetings 2-4

Use `meetings/meeting-1/discussion-guide.md` as template. Update:
1. Core Framing Question (copy from key-questions.md)
2. Understanding Current State questions (adapt to meeting focus)
3. Exploring Concepts questions (specific to chapters)
4. Real-World Scenarios (create relevant examples)
5. Team Self-Assessment (adapt to meeting capabilities)
6. Reflection and Commitment questions

**Key insight:** The core structure is identical. Only the content (questions, concepts, examples) changes to match each meeting's chapters.

## Template Variables by Meeting

### Meeting 2
- **Chapters:** 4-6
- **Title:** Technical Excellence & Continuous Delivery
- **Key Concepts:** Five CD principles, loosely coupled architecture, shift-left security
- **Action Items:** Identify automation opportunities, map dependencies, experiment with CD practice
- **Icebreaker:** "How many steps are in your deployment process? How many are manual?"

### Meeting 3
- **Chapters:** 7-10
- **Title:** Management, Product Development & Sustainability
- **Key Concepts:** Lean management, small batches, deployment pain, burnout factors
- **Action Items:** Visualize work, streamline change approval, document burnout risks
- **Icebreaker:** "How visible is your work-in-progress to the team and stakeholders?"

### Meeting 4
- **Chapters:** 11, 16, Conclusion
- **Title:** Leadership, Research Foundation & Transformation
- **Key Concepts:** Five leadership dimensions, ING case study, "make it your own"
- **Action Items:** Identify small transformation experiment, leadership support action, transformation plan
- **Icebreaker:** "What's the single smallest change that would make your next deployment less painful?"

## Files Ready to Use Immediately

Even without completing all template files, these are ready:
- ✅ All NotebookLM prompts (generate podcasts/videos now)
- ✅ Key questions framework (use in all meetings)
- ✅ 24 Capabilities assessment (baseline measurement)
- ✅ Book club roadmap (overview and success metrics)
- ✅ Meeting 1 complete resources
- ✅ All meeting outlines (outline.md)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Quick Win:** Use existing resources immediately for Meeting 1
2. **Template Completion:** Create remaining 9 files using templates (1-2 hours work)
3. **Cleanup:** Delete old files after confirming new structure works (30 min)
4. **Validation:** Run lint/build, test links (15 min)

Total estimated time to complete: **2-3 hours**

## Benefits Already Achieved

- ✅ Single source of truth for NotebookLM prompts (4 podcast formats + video)
- ✅ Holistic key questions framework connecting all meetings
- ✅ Comprehensive 24 capabilities assessment tool
- ✅ Clear book club roadmap and success metrics
- ✅ Meeting 1 fully ready to facilitate
