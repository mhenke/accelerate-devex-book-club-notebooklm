# Missing Assessments - Issue Report

## Problem

The repository has **numerous references to assessment files that don't exist**. These are linked throughout the documentation but the `resources/assessments/` directory is completely missing.

## Missing Files

### Critical Missing Files:

1. **`resources/assessments/24-capabilities-assessment.md`**
   - Referenced in: 10+ files
   - Purpose: Self-assessment covering all 24 capabilities from Accelerate research
   - Expected to have 1-5 scale rating for each capability

2. **`resources/assessments/dora-metrics-template.md`**
   - Referenced in: 8+ files
   - Purpose: Template for establishing DORA metrics baseline
   - Should include: Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, MTTR, Change Failure Rate

3. **`resources/assessments/culture-assessment-worksheet.md`**
   - Referenced in: 3+ files
   - Purpose: Worksheet to document culture behaviors (Pathological, Bureaucratic, Generative)

### Files Referencing Missing Assessments:

- `resources/book-club-roadmap.md` (6 references)
- `resources/README.md` (5 references)
- `resources/meetings/meeting-1/handouts/*.md` (multiple references)
- `resources/meetings/meeting-1/notebooklm/*.md` (multiple references)
- `resources/templates/retrospective-format.md`
- All meeting retrospective templates

## Impact

**High Priority** - These assessments are core to the book club experience:
- Participants can't complete pre-work assignments
- Meeting facilitators reference non-existent materials
- Action items can't be tracked
- Baseline metrics can't be established

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Create the Missing Assessments

Create comprehensive assessment files in `resources/assessments/`:

**24-capabilities-assessment.md** should include:
- All 24 capabilities from Accelerate organized by category:
  - Continuous Delivery (8 capabilities)
  - Architecture (2 capabilities)
  - Product & Process (3 capabilities)
  - Lean Management & Monitoring (4 capabilities)
  - Cultural (5 capabilities)
  - Leadership (2 capabilities)
- 1-5 rating scale for each
- Scoring interpretation guide
- Action planning section

**dora-metrics-template.md** should include:
- Lead Time for Changes (tracking template)
- Deployment Frequency (tracking template)
- Mean Time to Recovery (tracking template)
- Change Failure Rate (tracking template)
- Performance level interpretation (Elite, High, Medium, Low)
- Baseline establishment instructions

**culture-assessment-worksheet.md** should include:
- Westrum culture model explanation
- Observation template for each type:
  - Pathological (power-oriented)
  - Bureaucratic (rule-oriented)
  - Generative (performance-oriented)
- Behavior examples and patterns
- Team culture improvement planning

### Option 2: Remove References

If assessments won't be created, remove all references to:
- `assessments/24-capabilities-assessment.md`
- `assessments/dora-metrics-template.md`
- `assessments/culture-assessment-worksheet.md`
- `assessments/` directory references

**Files to update:** ~20+ markdown files

### Option 3: Link to External Resources

Replace internal assessment links with external resources:
- DORA Quick Check: https://dora.dev/quickcheck/
- Google's DORA Metrics: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance
- State of DevOps Report resources

## Priority: HIGH

This should be addressed before promoting the book club materials as participants will encounter broken links immediately when trying to complete pre-work.

## Next Steps

1. Decide on approach (Create, Remove, or External Links)
2. If creating: Draft assessment content based on Accelerate book
3. Test all links after implementation
4. Update any additional references found
