   - **performance-analysis**: Performance optimization suggestions
   - **documentation-update**: Documentation improvements
   - **dependency-update**: Package dependency review

### Daily Health Checks

The workflow automatically runs daily at 9 AM UTC to:
- Check code quality metrics
- Review linting and build results
- Identify technical debt
- Suggest improvements
- Create issues for critical problems

## üîß Workflow Features

### Main Workflow (`claude.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Issues, PR comments, PR reviews
- **Permissions**: Contents, pull-requests, issues (write access)
- **Security**: Includes security scanning of Claude's changes
- **Testing**: Runs tests after Claude makes changes

### Advanced Workflow (`claude-advanced.yml`)
- **Scheduled runs**: Daily health checks
- **Manual triggers**: On-demand specialized tasks
- **PR reviews**: Automatic code review for new pull requests
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Deep dives into specific areas

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Automatic Security Scanning
- Checks for hardcoded secrets in Claude's changes
- Validates that changes don't introduce security vulnerabilities
- Fails the workflow if potential issues are detected

- Uses minimal required permissions
- GitHub token has limited scope
- All changes are committed with clear attribution

### Change Attribution

```

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Issues
- Be specific about what you want Claude to do
- Provide context about the problem
- Mention relevant files or areas of the codebase

### For Pull Requests
- Ask Claude to focus on specific aspects (security, performance, etc.)
- Request line-by-line feedback for complex changes
- Use `[skip claude]` in PR title to skip automatic review

### For Code Reviews
- Tag Claude early in the development process
- Ask for suggestions on architecture decisions
- Request refactoring recommendations

## üîç Example Commands

```bash
# In issue comments:
@claude can you help optimize the CSS consolidation we just completed?

@claude please review the key-question text wrapping fix and suggest any improvements

@claude can you audit this codebase for potential security vulnerabilities?

# In PR comments:
@claude please review this responsive design implementation

@claude can you check if this follows our CSS architecture patterns?

@claude please suggest performance optimizations for this code
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Claude doesn't respond**
   - Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
   - Verify the GitHub App is installed with proper permissions
   - Ensure you're mentioning `@claude` (case-sensitive)

2. **Permission errors**
   - Verify repository permissions in GitHub App settings
   - Check that workflow has proper permissions in YAML

3. **API rate limits**
   - Anthropic API has rate limits
   - Large repositories may hit token limits
   - Consider breaking large requests into smaller chunks

### Getting Help

- Check the Actions tab for workflow run details
- Review the workflow logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all required secrets are configured
- Verify GitHub App installation and permissions
