# NotebookLM Video Generation Guidelines
*Accelerate DevEx Book Club Meeting Videos*

## General Guidelines for All Videos

### Consistent Messaging Across Videos
- These are based on rigorous research by Forsgren, Humble, and Kim
- The goal is practical application, not just theoretical understanding
- High performance means both speed AND stability, never trade-offs
- Culture and technical practices are deeply interconnected
- Small, incremental changes lead to transformation

### Audience Considerations
- **Primary Audience:** Software developers, DevOps practitioners, engineering managers
- **Experience Level:** Mixed - from junior developers to senior leaders
- **Context:** Part of a structured book club, not standalone content
- **Goal:** Prepare for discussion, not replace reading the book

### Video Tone and Style Preferences
- **Conversational but informative:** Like experienced practitioners sharing insights
- **Evidence-based:** Reference the research behind recommendations
- **Practical:** Include concrete examples and actionable advice
- **Encouraging:** Frame challenges as opportunities for improvement
- **Inclusive:** Use language that welcomes all experience levels

### Key Reminders for Each Video
1. **Encourage Book Purchase:** Mention that these videos supplement but don't replace reading "Accelerate"
2. **Connect to Developer Experience:** Always tie concepts back to daily developer work
3. **Prepare for Discussion:** End with thought-provoking questions for the book club meeting
4. **Research Foundation:** Emphasize these are data-driven insights, not opinions
5. **Actionable Focus:** Include specific practices teams can try
