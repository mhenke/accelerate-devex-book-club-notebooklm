# Accelerate DevEx Book Club

Concise, useful README for the Jekyll site and resource hub built around the book "Accelerate" (Forsgren, Humble, Kim).

This repository contains a static site (Jekyll) with meeting guides, AI-generated prompts and media workflows, assessments, and reusable UI/CSS components used for an interactive, accessibility-minded book club experience.

Key goals:
- Teach and apply high-performing DevEx practices using the 24-capabilities framework and DORA metrics.
- Provide meeting materials, notebook prompts (NotebookLM), and podcast/video-ready content.
- Ship responsive, accessible visuals built with SCSS + SVG (no primary static images).

Contents at a glance
- `docs/` ‚Äî Jekyll site source (pages, layouts, assets, and `_meetings/` content).
- `resources/` ‚Äî AI prompts, meeting plans, assessments, and templates.
- `assets/` and `docs/_sass/` ‚Äî styles and design tokens (`_tokens.scss`).
- `media/` ‚Äî local media used to compute durations (not committed to repo).
- `scripts/` ‚Äî helpers (e.g., `extract-durations.js`).

Quick start (local)
1. Install Ruby + Bundler and Node.js/npm.
2. From repo root, install site gems and start Jekyll dev server:

```bash
# in zsh
cd docs
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:4000/accelerate-devex-book-club-notebooklm/

Common npm scripts (run from repo root)
- npm run serve       # runs Jekyll local server via npm script
- npm run build       # build site (Jekyll)
- npm run build:production  # build + optimize CSS (PurgeCSS)
- npm run lint        # run ESLint + Stylelint
- npm run validate    # full pipeline: build + lint + tests

Editing & conventions
- Edit content in `docs/` and `resources/` (meeting prompts live in `resources/meetings/`).
- SCSS tokens live in `docs/_sass/abstracts/_tokens.scss` ‚Äî change tokens for global palette/spacing.
- All SCSS partials in `docs/assets/` must include YAML front matter so Jekyll compiles them.
- Visuals: prefer CSS/SVG for hero, infographics, and badges (no primary raster images).
- Accessibility: use semantic HTML and ARIA landmarks; all landmarks should have non-empty accessible names.

Testing & validation
- Quick: `npm run lint && npm run build` ‚Äî fast feedback during development.
- Full validation (recommended before commits): `npm run validate` ‚Äî runs build, linters, and tests.
- HTML validation: `npm run test:html` or `bundle exec htmlproofer _site` after running the server.
- Playwright E2E tests live in `tests/` (run via `npm test` inside `tests/`).

Media tooling
- To update media durations used in meeting pages:

```bash
node extract-durations.js
```

Notes for maintainers
- Keep interactive scripts accessible: avoid browser `confirm()` and prefer managed dialogs with focus management.
- When changing layout/partials, edit source under `docs/_layouts/` (do not edit `docs/_site/` directly).
- Use the design tokens and meeting theme classes (`.meeting-theme--N`) for consistent theming.

Contributing
- Follow standard GitHub flow: feature branches and PRs.
- Run `npm run validate` before creating a PR to ensure build and lint pass.
