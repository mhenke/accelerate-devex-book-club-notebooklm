# Introduction

![Status: In progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20progress-yellow)

This plan refactors and standardizes all CSS for meeting pages and reusable components. All duplicated patterns will be consolidated into atomic, reusable blocks. All color, spacing, and font values must use existing SCSS variables. Icon usage in headings and blocks will be standardized to a single documented pattern (FontAwesome `<i>` with `.icon` class, or CSS pseudo-element, but not both). Inline styles will be removed from all source files. All solutions must be simple, maintainable, and follow best practices for accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) and performance. All validation criteria are explicit and machine-verifiable.
