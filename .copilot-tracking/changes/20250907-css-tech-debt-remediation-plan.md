## Overview

CSS tech debt includes inline styles, duplicated block patterns, inconsistent variable usage, and accessibility gaps. These issues reduce maintainability, performance, and user experience.

## Explanation

- **Inline styles**: Hard to maintain, block theming, and reduce performance.
- **Duplicated blocks**: Cause code bloat, inconsistencies, and hinder reuse.
- **CSS variables**: Inconsistent usage leads to hardcoded values and poor scalability.
- **Accessibility**: Some blocks lack semantic markup and color contrast.

## Requirements

- Access to all HTML/Markdown files, `_includes`, `_layouts`, and `_sass`.
- Font Awesome and Jekyll includes must be available.
- Ability to run accessibility and performance audits.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit and Remove Inline Styles**
   - Search for inline style attributes (for example: `style="..."`) and `<style>` blocks in all HTML/Markdown files.
   - Replace inline styles with CSS classes using variables from `:root`.
   - Validate with CSS linter.
2. **Refactor Duplicated Blocks**
   - Identify repeated blocks (cards, alerts, info, meeting-hero, metric-card).
   - Move markup to Jekyll includes and apply reusable CSS classes.
   - Update all pages to use includes/classes.
3. **Standardize CSS Variables**
   - Expand variables in `:root` for colors, spacing, borders.
   - Refactor blocks to use `var(--property)` for all styling.
   - Remove hardcoded values.
4. **Accessibility and Performance Fixes**
   - Ensure all blocks use semantic HTML and ARIA where needed.
   - Check color contrast and keyboard navigation.
   - Run accessibility audit (e.g., Accessibility Insights).
   - Optimize CSS for performance (minify, remove unused rules).

## Testing

- Run CSS and HTML linters.
- Validate accessibility with automated tools and manual review.
- Test performance with Lighthouse or similar.
- Confirm all pages render correctly and consistently.
