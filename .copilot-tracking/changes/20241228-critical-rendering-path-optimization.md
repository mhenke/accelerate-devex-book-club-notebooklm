  - Touch target optimization (44px minimum)
  - FOUC prevention system
  - Intersection observer for viewport optimizations
  - Memory usage monitoring and cleanup
  - Hover and scroll optimizations
  - Animation lifecycle management

### 1.6 Critical CSS Extraction Tool ✅

- **Status:** Complete
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Automated critical CSS extraction
  - 14KB performance budget validation
  - Multi-viewport analysis (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Jekyll integration with includes
  - Performance reporting and monitoring

## 🔄 Phase 2: Implementation & Migration (IN PROGRESS)

### 2.1 Legacy CSS Integration ⚠️

- **Current:** Partial integration started
- **Files:** `/docs/assets/main.scss` updated with new imports
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Gradually migrate legacy styles to modular components
  2. Extract critical vs non-critical content
  3. Validate no visual regressions

### 2.2 Build Process Integration 🔄

- **Status:** Architecture ready, tooling needs implementation
- **Required:**
  - Jekyll build process updates
  - Critical CSS extraction in CI/CD
  - Performance budget enforcement
  - Automated testing integration

## 🎯 Phase 3: Next Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Immediate Tasks (This Sprint)

1. **Critical CSS Extraction** (Priority 1)

   - Build Jekyll site with new architecture
   - Run critical CSS extraction tool
   - Validate <14KB budget compliance
   - Test above-the-fold rendering

2. **Legacy Style Migration** (Priority 2)

   - Migrate hero banner styles to critical
   - Move DORA metrics to components
   - Extract non-critical styles to async load
   - Validate visual consistency

3. **Performance Validation** (Priority 3)
   - Run Lighthouse audit with new architecture
   - Measure Core Web Vitals improvements
   - Validate FOUC prevention
   - Test will-change memory usage

### 3.2 Technical Debt Resolution

- **Static will-change declarations:** Replaced with dynamic JavaScript management
- **Monolithic CSS file:** Refactored to modular SCSS 7-1-lite architecture
- **FOUC issues:** Prevention system implemented
- **Touch target violations:** Automated 44px enforcement

## 📊 Performance Metrics Tracking

### Baseline (Before Implementation)

- **Load Time:** 886ms
- **DOM Ready:** 257ms
- **Will-change Issues:** 460332px memory budget exceeded
- **Touch Targets:** 19 elements <44px
- **Critical CSS:** Estimated >20KB (monolithic)
