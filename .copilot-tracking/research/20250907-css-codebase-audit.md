# Task Research Notes: CSS Codebase Audit

## Research Executed

### File Analysis

- docs/assets/main.scss
  - Main stylesheet, contains design tokens, base styles, layout, card, interactive, meeting, navigation, attribution, media, utility, responsive, and print styles. Large, monolithic, mixes variables, components, and utility classes.
- docs/\_sass/components/\_metrics.scss
  - Metrics and visualization components. Contains DORA metrics, performance cards, assessment results, statistics, progress indicators, and comparison metrics. Many nested selectors, some overlap with main.scss, inconsistent variable usage.

### Code Search Results

- "metric-icon"
  - Found in both main.scss and \_metrics.scss, with different implementations and style scopes.
- "meeting-card"
  - Multiple style definitions, some duplicated or overridden in main.scss and possibly other files.
- "gradient|linear-gradient"
  - Used for backgrounds in many components, but not standardized across files.

### External Research

- #githubRepo:"mhenke/accelerate-devex-book-club-notebooklm CSS refactor"
  - No clear modularization or BEM/OOCSS/SMACSS conventions. Mix of custom properties and hardcoded values. Large files, little separation of concerns.
- #fetch:https://sass-lang.com/guide
  - Recommends modular partials, clear variable naming, and separation of concerns for maintainability.

### Project Conventions

- Standards referenced: Design tokens via CSS custom properties, some use of SCSS variables and mixins, but not consistently applied.
- Instructions followed: No clear documentation for CSS architecture or refactoring standards in repo.

## Key Discoveries

### Project Structure

- CSS is split between a large main.scss and several component partials (e.g., \_metrics.scss).
- Many styles are duplicated or overridden between files.
- Utility classes and design tokens are defined in main.scss, but not always used in components.
- No clear modularization, naming conventions, or architecture (e.g., BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS).

### Implementation Patterns

- Heavy use of nested selectors in SCSS, leading to specificity issues.
- Inconsistent use of variables and custom properties.
- Mix of global, component, and utility styles in single files.
- Responsive and print styles are embedded in main.scss, not separated.

### Complete Examples

```scss
// Example: Duplicated metric-icon styles
.metric-icon {
  font-size: 3rem;
  margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);
  display: block;
}
// ...also defined in _metrics.scss with different properties...
```

### API and Schema Documentation

- No CSS architecture documentation found in repo.

### Configuration Examples

```scss
:root {
  --header-dark-navy: #1a1a2e;
  // ...other tokens...
}
```

### Technical Requirements

- Refactor for maintainability, modularity, and consistency.
- Standardize variable usage and naming conventions.
- Reduce duplication and specificity conflicts.

## Recommended Approach

- Audit all CSS/SCSS files for duplication, specificity, and variable usage.
- Modularize styles by component/function (e.g., metrics, cards, navigation).
- Adopt a naming convention (BEM, OOCSS, or SMACSS) and document it.
- Move design tokens and utility classes to dedicated partials.
- Refactor nested selectors to reduce specificity and improve maintainability.
- Document architecture and refactoring plan for contributors.

## Implementation Guidance

- **Objectives**: Achieve maintainable, modular, and consistent CSS codebase.
- **Key Tasks**: Audit files, identify duplication, modularize, standardize variables, refactor selectors, document conventions.
- **Dependencies**: None blocking, but may require team alignment on conventions.
- **Success Criteria**: Reduced duplication, clear modular structure, documented conventions, easier future maintenance.
