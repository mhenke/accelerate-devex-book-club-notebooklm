# Test Strategy: Interactive Learning Platform

## Test Strategy Overview

This comprehensive test strategy applies ISTQB testing principles and ISO 25010 quality characteristics to validate the Accelerate DevEx Book Club educational platform. The strategy focuses on ensuring educational effectiveness, accessibility compliance, cross-platform compatibility, and maintainable quality standards for the Jekyll-based learning environment.

**Testing Scope**: Complete educational platform including interactive assessments, meeting guides, responsive design, and AI-generated content integration.

**Quality Objectives**:

- 100% functional coverage of learning interactions
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- > 95% cross-browser/device compatibility
- <2s page load times across all content
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Maintainable test automation coverage >85%

**Risk Assessment**: Primary risks include learning experience degradation on mobile devices, accessibility barriers for diverse learners, and educational content accuracy validation.

## ISTQB Framework Implementation

### Test Design Techniques Selection

#### Equivalence Partitioning

- **Input Domain Partitioning**: User interaction patterns categorized by learning modality
  - Visual learners: Infographic and diagram interactions
  - Kinesthetic learners: Interactive assessment components
  - Auditory learners: AI-generated podcast content integration
  - Reading learners: Progressive text-based meeting guides

#### Boundary Value Analysis

- **Edge Case Identification**:
  - Minimum/maximum viewport dimensions (320px mobile to 4K desktop)
  - Network bandwidth extremes (slow 3G to high-speed broadband)
  - Browser capability boundaries (legacy vs. modern JavaScript support)
  - Content volume limits (assessment question counts, meeting guide length)

#### Decision Table Testing

- **Complex Business Rule Validation**:
  - Interactive assessment scoring algorithms
  - Conditional content display based on user progress
  - Theme-based styling application across meeting types
  - Responsive breakpoint behavior matrices

#### State Transition Testing

- **System State Behavior Validation**:
  - User progress through 4-meeting learning journey
  - Interactive component state changes (unchecked → checked → feedback displayed)
  - Theme transitions between meeting contexts
  - Mobile navigation state management (collapsed ↔ expanded)

#### Experience-Based Testing

- **Exploratory Testing Focus Areas**:
  - Educational flow effectiveness and engagement
  - Cross-cultural accessibility and inclusive design
