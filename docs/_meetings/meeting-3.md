# Meeting 3: Architecture, Autonomy, and Lean Thinking

**Week 5 | Duration:** 1 Hour

## Pre-Reading Assignment

**Chapters:** 9-12 (Organizational and Management Practices)

- Chapter 9: Making Work Sustainable
- Chapter 10: Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement
- Chapter 11: Leaders and Managers
- Chapter 12: Diversity in Tech

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Modular/Loosely Coupled Architecture

#### 🔗 Tightly Coupled vs 🧩 Loosely Coupled

- **Independent Team Work:** Teams can work without relying on other teams for support and services
- **Reduced Coordination Overhead:** Less communication required for changes
- **Kitchen Analogy:** Like chefs working independently on their dishes without constant coordination
- **Conway's Law Inverse:** Evolving team structures to match desired architecture

### 2. Empowerment Through Tool Selection

#### Benefits of Tool Autonomy:

- **🎨 Enhanced Creativity:** Freedom to choose tools that best fit the problem
- **📈 Increased Productivity:** Using familiar and efficient tools
- **😊 Higher Satisfaction:** Autonomy directly correlates with job satisfaction
- **💡 Innovation Driver:** Flexible policies lead to better solutions

### 3. Lean Management Principles

#### 🚦 Limit Work in Progress (WIP)

Using WIP limits to manage flow and drive process improvement

#### 👁️ Visualize Work

Making work and metrics visible to the team

#### 👥 Lightweight Change Approval

Peer review over external change approval boards

#### 🔄 Customer Feedback Integration

Getting early and frequent customer input

#### 📊 Data-Driven Decisions

Using monitoring and metrics to inform choices

### 4. Employee Satisfaction Drivers

- **Meaningful Work:** Appropriate challenges and purposeful tasks
- **Learning Opportunities:** Growth and development possibilities
- **Supportive Environment:** Team culture that enables success
- **Tool Access:** Having the right resources to do the job effectively

## Discussion Questions

1. **Architecture Assessment:** How well does your current architecture enable independent team work?
2. **Tool Autonomy:** What level of tool selection freedom do teams currently have?
3. **Lean Practices:** Which lean management practices are you currently using? Which could be adopted?
4. **WIP Visibility:** How do you currently visualize and limit work in progress?
5. **Developer Satisfaction:** What factors most impact job satisfaction in your organization?

## Practical Exercises

- Map current dependencies between teams and systems
- Identify bottlenecks in current change approval processes
- Assess current WIP limits and visualization practices

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- [ ] Document one architectural dependency that slows down your team
- [ ] Experiment with visualizing work using a simple kanban board
- [ ] Identify one process that could benefit from peer review instead of external approval
