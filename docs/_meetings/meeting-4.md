    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Transformation Mindset Requirements

- **Learn How to Learn:** Creating environment for shared organizational learning
- **Practice Discipline:** Recording time usage, trying uncomfortable new behaviors
- **Practice Patience:** Decades-old patterns take time to change into new habits and culture
- **Practice Practice:** Learn, succeed, fail, learn, adjust, repeat - rhythm and routine

### ING Transformation Lessons

### What Made ING's Transformation Successful

- **Leader Learning First:** Management team had to become learning team before helping others learn
- **Behavioral Change Drives Culture:** "When you change the way you work, you change the routines, you create different culture"
- **Quality-First Mindset:** "Speed with quality" - sometimes take longer initially but stay green vs others going back to red
- **Senior Support:** "Senior management is very happy with us" - providing air cover for transformation

### Key Transformation Challenges

- **Scaling Pressure:** Discipline to go deep before going wide despite pressure to scale quickly
- **Dispersed Teams:** Experimenting with maintaining collaboration across countries
- **Impatience:** "You get impatient wanting to speed their learning but...they have to have their own learning"
