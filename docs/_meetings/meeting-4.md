- **Practice Patience:** Decades-old patterns take time to change into new habits and culture
- **Practice Practice:** Learn, succeed, fail, learn, adjust, repeat - rhythm and routine

### ING Transformation Lessons

### What Made ING's Transformation Successful

- **Leader Learning First:** Management team had to become learning team before helping others learn
- **Behavioral Change Drives Culture:** "When you change the way you work, you change the routines, you create different culture"
- **Quality-First Mindset:** "Speed with quality" - sometimes take longer initially but stay green vs others going back to red
- **Senior Support:** "Senior management is very happy with us" - providing air cover for transformation

### Key Transformation Challenges

- **Scaling Pressure:** Discipline to go deep before going wide despite pressure to scale quickly
- **Dispersed Teams:** Experimenting with maintaining collaboration across countries
- **Impatience:** "You get impatient wanting to speed their learning but...they have to have their own learning"

### Discussion Questions

### Transformational Leadership Assessment

1. **Leadership Characteristics:** Which of the five transformational leadership dimensions are strongest/weakest in your organization? How do current leaders inspire and support vs command and control?

2. **Investment in Learning:** How does your organization currently invest in developing team capabilities? What gaps exist in training budgets, conference attendance, or experimentation time?

### ING Model Application

3. **Visual Management:** How might elements of ING's Obeya rooms be adapted to your context? What strategic objectives, performance gaps, and problems would benefit from visual management?

4. **Team Structure:** Could aspects of ING's tribe/squad structure improve collaboration and customer focus in your organization? What would need to change?

5. **Communication Flow:** How does problem escalation and resolution currently work in your teams? Where could "catchball" communication patterns improve information flow?

### Transformation Discipline

6. **Coaching vs Commanding:** What would it look like for leaders in your organization to shift toward asking supportive questions rather than giving direct orders?

7. **"Make It Your Own":** How can your team adopt a philosophy of experimentation and adaptation rather than copying practices? What from ING's approach resonates most with your context?

8. **Transformation Readiness:** Does your organization have the discipline and patience required for sustainable culture change? What are the biggest obstacles?

### Practical Exercises

### 1. Team Obeya Design {#team-obeya-design}

**Exercise:** Sketch a visual management board for your team

- Strategic objectives and current status
- Performance metrics and gaps (red/green coding)
- Current problems and escalation paths
- Work in progress and bottlenecks
- Actions and ownership

### 2. Coaching Questions Practice {#coaching-questions-practice}

**Exercise:** Role-play leadership scenarios

- Partner A presents a team obstacle or challenge
- Partner B practices asking open-ended, supportive coaching questions
- Focus on "What can I do to support you?" vs solving the problem directly
- Debrief on how this felt different from typical management interactions

### 3. "Adapt, Don't Copy" Planning {#adapt-dont-copy-planning}

**Exercise:** Choose one ING practice and adapt it

- Select specific practice (Obeya, catchball, squad structure, etc.)
- Identify what would need modification for your context
- Plan small experiment to test adapted version
- Define success metrics and learning objectives

### 4. Transformation Readiness Assessment {#transformation-readiness-assessment}

**Exercise:** Evaluate organizational change capacity

- Rate current leadership characteristics (1-5 scale) across five dimensions
- Identify biggest gaps in transformation discipline/patience
- Assess investment in learning and development
- Plan specific leadership behavior changes

### Action Items and Commitments

### Individual Leadership Commitments

- **Coaching Practice:** Use at least one supportive coaching question this week instead of giving direct instruction
- **Learning Investment:** Identify one way to invest in your team's capability development (training, conference, experimentation time)
- **Visual Management:** Create simple visual display of your team's current work and problems
- **Transformation Discipline:** Choose one recurring process and work with team to define "standard work" approach

### Team Experiments

- **Blameless Learning:** Conduct one "failure leads to inquiry" discussion about recent setback, focusing purely on system improvement
- **Communication Flow:** Map current problem escalation process and identify one improvement
- **Standard Work Development:** Define team's current best practice for one recurring activity (stand-ups, deployments, code review)

### Organizational Assessment

- **Leadership Characteristic Gap Analysis:** Identify which transformational leadership dimensions need development
- **ING Practice Adaptation:** Choose one element from ING case study to pilot in adapted form
- **Investment Planning:** Propose specific budget/time allocation for team learning and experimentation

### Culminating Reflection

### The Single Smallest Change Question

**"What is the single smallest change we can make that would make our next deployment just a tiny bit less painful?"**

This question embodies the entire Accelerate philosophy:

- Start small and build momentum
- Focus on concrete, measurable improvement
- Address real pain points that teams experience
- Create conditions for continuous improvement
