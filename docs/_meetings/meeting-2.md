# Meeting 2: Cultivating Culture and Embracing Continuous Delivery

**Week 3 | Duration:** 1 Hour

## Pre-Reading Assignment

**Chapters:** 5-8 (Continued Research Findings)

- Chapter 5: Architecture
- Chapter 6: Integrating Infosec into the Delivery Lifecycle
- Chapter 7: Management Practices for Software
- Chapter 8: Product Development

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Organizational Culture Types (Westrum's Typology)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pathological (Power-Oriented)

- Low cooperation
- Messengers shot
- Responsibility shirked

#### üìã Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)

- Modest cooperation
- Messengers neglected
- Narrow responsibilities

#### üöÄ Generative (Performance-Oriented)

- High cooperation
- Messengers trained
- Risks shared, bridging encouraged

### 2. "Act Your Way into a Better Culture"

- **Behavioral Change Drives Cultural Change:** How implementing practices transforms organizational culture
- **Practical Application:** Concrete actions that shift culture toward generative
- **Evidence:** Research showing DevOps practices improve both performance and culture

### 3. Continuous Delivery as Disciplined Approach

- **Definition:** Getting changes of all kinds into production safely, quickly, and sustainably
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments
- **Foundation:** The "engine that drives all of this" high performance

### 4. Core CD Principles and Practices

#### üèóÔ∏è Build Quality In

Starting with quality rather than inspecting it later

#### üì¶ Work in Small Batches

Breaking tasks into manageable, testable units

#### ü§ñ Automate Repetitive Tasks

Freeing humans for creative problem-solving

#### üìÇ Version Control Everything

All production artifacts under version control

#### üå≥ Trunk-Based Development

Short-lived branches and frequent integration

#### üß™ Comprehensive Test Automation

Automated testing at multiple levels

#### üìä Proactive Monitoring

Observability and alerting for rapid problem detection

## Discussion Questions

1. **Culture Assessment:** Using Westrum's model, how would you categorize your current organizational culture?
2. **Cultural Transformation Examples:** What behavioral changes have you seen that shifted culture?
3. **CD Maturity:** Which continuous delivery practices is your organization currently implementing?
4. **Automation Opportunities:** What repetitive tasks could be automated to improve developer experience?

## Real-World Applications

- Share examples of successful cultural shifts through practice implementation
- Discuss barriers to continuous delivery adoption
- Identify quick wins for improving CD practices

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- [ ] Observe and document culture type indicators in your daily work
- [ ] Identify one repetitive task that could be automated
- [ ] Experiment with working in smaller batches on current projects
