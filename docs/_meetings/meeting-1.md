## Pre-Reading Assignment

**Chapters:** 1-4 (Introduction and What We Found)
- Chapter 1: Accelerate
- Chapter 2: Measuring Performance  
- Chapter 3: Measuring and Changing Culture
- Chapter 4: Technical Practices

## Core Concepts to Explore

### 1. Introduction to "Accelerate"
- **Central Argument:** High software delivery performance drives organizational success
- **Evidence-Based Approach:** Understanding the rigorous research behind the book's findings
- **Digital Transformation Reality:** How software delivery capability provides competitive advantage

### 2. Addressing "Deployment Pain"
- **Recognition:** Nervousness before deployments as a signal of process inefficiencies, not personal failing
- **Root Causes:** Gaps between development and IT operations, differing workflows and terminologies
- **Impact Assessment:** How deployment anxiety affects team wellbeing and productivity

### 3. Debunking the Speed vs. Stability Myth
- **Key Insight:** High-performing organizations achieve both speed AND stability
- **Evidence:** Research showing no trade-offs between these metrics
- **Mindset Shift:** Understanding that practices making you faster also make you more stable

### 4. The Four DORA Metrics

<div class="metrics-grid">
  <div class="metric-card">
    <h4>üìà Delivery Lead Time</h4>
    <p>Time from code commit to production deployment</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="metric-card">
    <h4>üöÄ Deployment Frequency</h4>
    <p>How often code gets deployed to production</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="metric-card">
    <h4>‚è±Ô∏è Time to Restore Service</h4>
    <p>How quickly service is restored after incidents</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="metric-card">
    <h4>‚ùå Change Fail Rate</h4>
    <p>Percentage of deployments causing failures in production</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Discussion Questions

1. **Current State Assessment:** How would you rate your organization on each of the four DORA metrics?
2. **Deployment Pain Points:** What specific aspects of deployment cause anxiety in your team?
3. **Speed vs. Stability Experiences:** Share examples where you've seen (or assumed) trade-offs between speed and stability
4. **Measurement Gaps:** Which of the four metrics does your organization currently track? Which are missing?

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- [ ] Begin informal tracking of one DORA metric for your team
- [ ] Identify your biggest deployment pain point
- [ ] Observe one example of speed vs. stability trade-off thinking in your organization
