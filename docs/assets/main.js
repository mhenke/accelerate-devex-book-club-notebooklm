  // Continuous Delivery Principles Data
  cdInfo: {
    "build-quality": {
      title: "Build Quality In",
      content: "Quality should be built into the process from the start, not inspected later. This requires reliable test automation at all levels (unit, API, UI), continuous testing throughout development, and automated tests running against every commit. This practice reduces rework and increases confidence in deployments."

  // Dependency Management Data
  dependencyInfo: {
    "shared-database": {
      title: "Shared Database Dependency",
      content: "Shared databases create tight coupling between teams and services. According to Accelerate research, this significantly impacts deployment frequency and lead time. Teams must coordinate changes, creating bottlenecks and reducing autonomy. Consider database-per-service patterns or careful schema evolution strategies."
    },
    "release-coordination": {
      title: "Release Coordination Dependency", 
      content: "When teams must coordinate releases, it indicates architectural coupling and reduces deployment frequency. The Accelerate book emphasizes that high-performing teams can deploy independently. Consider trunk-based development, feature flags, and backward-compatible API changes to eliminate coordination needs."
    },
    "independent-services": {
      title: "Independent Services",
      content: "Independent services enable loose coupling and autonomous team operation. This architectural pattern correlates with high software delivery performance in Accelerate research.

  // Work in Progress Tracking Data
  wipInfo: {
    "task-lists": {
      title: "Task Lists for WIP Tracking",
      content: "Simple task lists provide basic visibility but lack flow optimization. While better than no tracking, they don't enforce WIP limits or highlight bottlenecks. Consider evolving to visual systems that limit work in progress and make flow problems visible."
    },
    "kanban": {
      title: "Kanban Boards",
      content: "Kanban boards excel at visualizing flow and limiting WIP. They align with lean principles from manufacturing that influenced DevOps practices. The visual nature helps identify bottlenecks and optimize flow. According to Accelerate research, teams that limit batch sizes and visualize work achieve better performance."
    },
    "sprint": {
      title: "Sprint/Scrum Boards", 
      content: "Sprint boards provide time-boxed visibility and can work well when integrated with continuous delivery practices. The key is maintaining small batch sizes within sprints. Accelerate research shows that working in small batches - regardless of framework - correlates with higher performance."
    },
    "none": {
      title: "No WIP Tracking",
      content: "Without WIP visualization, teams lose critical visibility into flow and bottlenecks. This makes it difficult to identify improvement opportunities and limits the ability to optimize delivery. Consider implementing basic Kanban visualization as a first step toward better flow management."

Even a single test reduces manual verification and begins establishing the safety net needed for frequent deployments."
    },
    "deployment-checklist": {
      title: "Create Deployment Checklist",
      content: "A simple checklist ensures consistent deployments and captures tribal knowledge. While manual, it's a stepping stone to automation and reduces human error.

    "monitor-key-metric": {
      title: "Monitor One Key Metric",
      content: "Start monitoring one critical business or system metric to enable data-driven decisions.
